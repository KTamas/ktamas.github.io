<![CDATA[<p>I signed the new contract for my apartment a couple days ago. There has been a change: my youngest sister is moving in with her boyfriend, so one of my friends is taking her place.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll miss my sister. We get along well and enjoy each other&rsquo;s company. In practice, she&rsquo;s been gone for more, than six months now: spending the majority of her time at her boyfriend&rsquo;s place and coming home for only a couple days a month. I&rsquo;m happy for her, but I still miss her. So I&rsquo;ve been living alone for a while now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve lived alone on and off during the last decade or so. I&rsquo;ve been privileged enough to be able to pick my flatmates. I have an aversion of living with strangers, so I always picked people I know, friends or at least acquaintances.</p>

<p>Of course, just because you know the person moving in with you, does not mean you know how it&rsquo;s like to actually live with them. I got lucky with that as well so far; all my flatmates were great, and we got along well. I&rsquo;m hoping for the same with my new one.</p>

<p>I could have looked for another place to live when I got the news from my sister, but this is one of the best apartments I&rsquo;ve had so far. It&rsquo;s the right size, it has a big kitchen with a gas stove and a lot of working area, there&rsquo;s a decent amount of natural light and most importantly, it has AC — something that&rsquo;s rare in Hungary — for the humid 35°C (95°F) summers we have in Budapest. There are two big, separate rooms, perfect for two people. It would be nice to have an additional living room, but still, I really can&rsquo;t complain. And it&rsquo;s affordable, especially for the area it&rsquo;s in: the rent is 440€, with the total being around 490-520€ per month, the latter including utilities and Internet. All of that gets divided between two people, of course.</p>

<p>The location is excellent, well-connected, with major metro and tram lines closeby. It&rsquo;s not quite in the heart of Budapest, but everything is still pretty close.</p>

<p><em>(I feel like I&rsquo;m writing an ad for the apartment here, but no, you can&rsquo;t have it.)</em></p>

<hr />

<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take me a while to adjust to living with someone again, but I&rsquo;m hoping for the best.</p>
