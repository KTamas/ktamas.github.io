<p>My father is a semi-amateur photographer; I got my affinity towards photography from him. I grew up watching him taking pictures. After high school, I got a job and soon I had disposable income, so I got my first digital camera: the <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/olympuse1">Olympus E-1</a>.</p>

<p>That was in 2008, and by then, it was already outdated. Released in 2003, it had a first-generation micro <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> sensor, 5 megapixels and ISO 800 was barely usable. That didn&rsquo;t stop me; it was a camera I was familiar with because my father had one for years. I frequently borrowed my dad&rsquo;s excellent <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/products/olympus/lenses/oly_14-54_2p8-3p5">14-54mm f/2.8-3.5</a> which is still one of the best glasses ever made. The combination of the lens and the camera took good pictures, ones that look great even in 2019.</p>

<p>In those early days I photographed a lot of things, but after a while I kind realized that I mostly like shooting people and that&rsquo;s where my passion&rsquo;s at. Portraits, parties, events, families and so on.</p>

<hr />

<p>The first phone I owned that could take pictures was the Blackberry 9000 (I still miss that keyboard&hellip;). The image quality was pretty bad by today&rsquo;s standards, but it was a start. After that, I had two Android phones; they were a bit better, but still not great. The first phone with a decent camera arrived to me in 2013 in the form of an iPhone 4S, and I was a convert. I took a lot of photos in the next few years with it and the other iPhones I eventually upgraded to (a 5S, then a 6+ then back to the 5S). People were still my focus, but I also took a lot of random pictures for social media. The 5S was surprisingly capable of capturing a good sunset.</p>

<hr />

<p>I started playing with film photography around 2010, borrowing my dad&rsquo;s <a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Contax_137_MD">Contax SLR</a> collecting dust. I bought a roll of black and white film for it and started shooting with a <a href="https://phillipreeve.net/blog/review-carl-zeiss-planar-1450-cy/">Zeiss 50mm f/1.4 lens</a>. Later on, I&rsquo;d get a <a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Canon_Canonet_QL_17_/_QL_19_/_QL_25">Canonet QL19 rangefinder</a>, and shot a few rolls with that. I gave that one away to a friend, something I kind of regret. Then again, getting a new one wouldn&rsquo;t cost too much. I took some of my best photos to this day on film and I almost always shot black and white, there was just something to it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Shooting with an analog SLR spoils you with that big, beautiful viewfinder. I became obsessed with getting a full-frame DSLR, which were not quite affordable until Canon released the 6D and Nikon the D600 around 2012. It took me a couple of years, but at the end of 2013 I was finally able to afford one. I got the 6D and eventually two lenses for it: the 40mm f/2.8 pancake and the 85mm f/1.8, the latter being my favorite lens to this day: it&rsquo;s razor-sharp and takes the best portraits. I got a flash for it as well, and it sort of became my &ldquo;work&rdquo; camera. I got into party photography and became really good at dancing with a heavy DSLR in one hand. I even got paid for it sometimes.</p>

<hr />

<p>From the earliest days, I shot in RAW and used Lightroom Classic (née Lightroom). By now my brain is hardwired for it. I have a good workflow, and I can edit the 800 pictures I took on a party down to about 60 good ones in 2-3 hours.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the middle of 2015 and I was about to leave for a couple of months of work and travel in Southern Europe. I didn&rsquo;t want to lug my heavy 6D around, but I felt that having only a phone was not enough. It was a perfect excuse for me to finally buy a Fuji X-E1. By then I was already infected with a fascination with Fuji&rsquo;s mirrorless cameras because one of my former best friends was really into them. I got two lenses for it, the 35mm f/1.4 and the 18-55 f/2.8-4. The autofocus and the EVF sucks, but it makes the most beautiful black and white JPEGs. They have a certain kind of magic to them.</p>

<p>I used it with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye-Fi">Eye-Fi card</a> I got a few months prior, an SD card with built-in WiFi that sends all the pictures you take to your phone. Combining that with <a href="https://writetogether.space/posts/ktamas/got-my-paperang-sf-xoxo-2018-series-part-3">my instant printers</a>, I could take DSLR-quality portraits of people and hand it to them printed out two minutes later. It never fails to amaze.</p>

<hr />

<p>By 2018 my enthusiasm for photography has started to dwindle. I was still talking random snapshots with my aging 5S, but I stopped carrying my Fuji with me in my backpack. I also stopped going to the kind of parties where I&rsquo;d take pictures. I got myself a Pixel 2 to finally upgrade my phone, which briefly got me interested in photography again, and later on, I switched to an iPhone X, which I used for a <a href="http://facesofxoxo2018.tumblr.com">series of portraits</a> (and instant pictures) on XOXO 2018.</p>

<hr />

<p>Nowadays most of my equipment is collecting dust. My creativity gets channeled into other things: <a href="https://instagram.com/ktamasart">drawing</a> and <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com">writing</a>. I think part of the reason I stopped doing photography is that it can create a distance between you and whatever you&rsquo;re taking pictures. Without my camera, I am often more present.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the future will bring, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if eventually I&rsquo;d start taking more pictures again.</p>
