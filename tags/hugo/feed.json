It\u0026rsquo;s got history: I set it up in early 2009, and I have almost 600 posts, mostly in Hungarian. I had one before that, between 2005 and 2008, but it was lost due to a variety of reasons, including my failure to properly back things up. Small bits of it are still \u003ca href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20070208165650/http://blog.ktamas.com/\"\u003eup in the Wayback Machine\u003c/a\u003e, though. It was all in Wordpress, which does its job, though even in 2019 it can be a pain to update things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"from-wordpress-to-jekyll-to-hugo\"\u003eFrom Wordpress to Jekyll to Hugo\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAbout a week ago I decided it was time to migrate it to \u003ca href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\"\u003eJekyll\u003c/a\u003e. I was bored, and it gave me a good excuse to play with a static site generator. Plus, doing this kind of conversion became a rite of passage for people working in tech these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is not a complete guide; you can find hundreds of them with a \u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+wordpress+to+jekyll\"\u003equick google\u003c/a\u003e. I will, however, provide a general overview of the process with some helpful pointers and links.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI started by migrating all the comments to Disqus with their \u003ca href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/disqus-comment-system/\"\u003eofficial Wordpress plugin\u003c/a\u003e. After that, I used a \u003ca href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jekyll-exporter/\"\u003eJekyll exporter plugin\u003c/a\u003e that converted all my posts into markdown\u0026hellip; except it stripped all the embeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI used to blog a lot about music, so I had a lot of embeds, mostly from Youtube. In retrospect, I could have saved myself some time by patching the exporter or finding another one. In the end, however, I ended up fixing every single post by hand. I replaced old, pre-iframe flash embed codes with updated ones and changed the newer, but still http ones to https. In most places, if the video was not necessary or wasn\u0026rsquo;t available anymore, I added the song to the post via Spotify. The chances of a given song being up on Spotify in a few years feels \u003cem\u003emarginally\u003c/em\u003e higher than on Youtube right now. I had a few other embeds that I could fix with newer code (Soundcloud) and others that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t (Deezer), but most of the time I could find the given song or playlist within Spotify. All of this had the benefit of walking down on memory lane, reading 10-year old blog posts and cringing a lot. \u003cem\u003eI was so young.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve found a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/vinitkumar/white-paper\"\u003ereasonably decent theme\u003c/a\u003e for Jekyll, which felt like a good starting point, though it didn\u0026rsquo;t have built-in support for tags or archives. I started googling how to implement that, and around the same time I was venting about my embed issues on the XOXO slack. That was when \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/theory\"\u003eDavid\u003c/a\u003e chimed in about his experiences on doing this exact same process, except he ended up using \u003ca href=\"https://gohugo.io\"\u003eHugo\u003c/a\u003e, another popular static site generator that\u0026rsquo;s kind of like Jekyll except faster. \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/theory/justatheory/tree/master/themes/justatheory\"\u003eThe theme\u003c/a\u003e of \u003ca href=\"https://justatheory.com\"\u003ehis blog\u003c/a\u003e had everything I wanted: a fancy archives page and proper support for tags. So I figured I might as well continue my journey: switch to Hugo and use his theme as a basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJekyll is written in Ruby and uses a simple templating language. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s code is in Go, and it uses Go\u0026rsquo;s own templates; they definitely have a learning curve, even if you have coded in Go before. With some help, googling and a lot of trial and error, I got the hang of it and managed to change things to my liking as well as the look and the color scheme of the site. I converted most of my posts\u0026rsquo; \u003ca href=\"https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/\"\u003efront matter\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/coderzh/ConvertToHugo\"\u003ewith a script\u003c/a\u003e and fixed the rest with a few search-and-replaces. With 8-10 hours of work behind me — half of that was fixing those embeds — I had my new blog ready to be \u003ca href=\"https://pages.github.com/\"\u003ehosted on Github Pages for free\u003c/a\u003e. I use a modified version of the \u003ca href=\"https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#put-it-into-a-script-1\"\u003esample deploy script\u003c/a\u003e they have in Hugo\u0026rsquo;s documentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"getting-rid-of-my-vps\"\u003eGetting Rid of My VPS\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI had a small VPS at Linode for years now, hosting my pet projects, my blog and a bunch of static sites (like my \u003ca href=\"https://ktamas.com\"\u003ehome page\u003c/a\u003e) over the years. It also had OpenVPN installed so I could watch iPlayer for free until BBC started cracking down on that. By now it only had my blog and those static sites; I figured if I could find something for the latter, I could ditch the VPS entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t remember how, but I came across \u003ca href=\"https://netlify.com\"\u003eNetlify\u003c/a\u003e. They give you free static hosting with extremely generous soft limits (100 gigs of storage, 100 GB/month transfer). You just point them to a Github repository, and about 30 seconds later you have your site ready, with support for multiple custom domains and SSL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI spent an hour or two moving everything to Netlify, changing the necessary DNS entries and in the end, I was ready to say goodbye to my VPS and save a grand total of $7 a month in the future. I made backups of everything and then, somewhat emotionally pressed the \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo; button on Linode\u0026rsquo;s control panel. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if I would get another one eventually for a side project or something, but for now, I\u0026rsquo;m happy with my all my stuff hosted around the internet for free and stored in git repos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"on-the-future-of-my-blog\"\u003eOn the Future of My Blog\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMaking this move also means that I will start cross-posting my posts from \u003ca href=\"https://writetogether.space/users/ktamas\"\u003eWriteTogether\u003c/a\u003e to here. One-off posts like this one will definitely make it here; the ongoing series I have at WriteTogether will probably stay there until they are done, and then I\u0026rsquo;ll re-edit them into long-form posts and publish them here.
