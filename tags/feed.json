This is nothing new; in the past, they\u0026rsquo;d pay for your trip and accommodation to NYC. On top of that, you receive a $256 honorarium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis being a virtual conference, no trips were involved, but speakers did need good audio and video for their talks. The organizers covered everyone\u0026rsquo;s cost to get a good webcam and a microphone for up to around $250 (a soft limit). I was lucky and got a Logitech Brio immediately after my talk was accepted, just before the entire world ran out of webcams; others were less lucky. I also got a Blue Yeti microphone, which worked well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe original plan was for everyone to stream via \u003ca href=\"https://obsproject.com/\"\u003eOBS\u003c/a\u003e to a custom RTMP server, but this was eventually scrapped for several reasons. They ended up using \u003ca href=\"https://streamyard.com\"\u003eStreamYard\u003c/a\u003e instead. The service only requires a web browser; as a speaker, you open a link, share your mic, webcam and you\u0026rsquo;re good to go. This does not give you as much flexibility, but it does the job and works really well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a speaker, you also had the option to make a pre-recorded version of your talk and have them play it instead of doing it live, or just have it as a backup in case something goes wrong; I think every virtual conference should implement a system like this. You had to record yourself and your presentation in two separate videos, and \u003ca href=\"confreaks.com\"\u003eConfreaks\u003c/a\u003e took care of the rest. The organizers also made sure to do an A/V check with every speaker before the conference, and you even had the option of sending them a separate video to upload to Youtube if you felt like your live talk could be improved in post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e!!Con was always livestreamed for free on Youtube. The perks you got if you had a ticket were access to a closed Discord server and a T-shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not the first virtual conference that organized their hallway track around Discord, but they went the extra mile and then some.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one, they set up a channel for each speaker\u0026rsquo;s talk, ordered by the schedule. As the day and the talks progressed, you would move from channel to channel, down on the list. This proved to be a brilliant idea: it was easy to keep track of the conversations, they were not in one big batch, and you could always go back to a given channel if you wanted to talk about a specific talk. More conferences should adopt this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommunication with the speakers also went through Discord; one had to keep it open because it was where they\u0026rsquo;d tell you if something was not right with your A/V setup or whatever. This proved to be a challenge for a few people as some presentation software — I\u0026rsquo;m looking at you, Keynote — blanks out all your screens while in presentation mode. But in those cases, the organizers could fall back to just texting the person. I had Discord open on my iPad since I was presenting from my laptop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey also had a bot that could match random people up to hang out. You would go to a channel and say \u0026ldquo;match me\u0026rdquo;, and if other people did the same in the next 60 (or later, 90) seconds, it\u0026rsquo;d create a Discord voice room and send everyone an invite. This worked okay, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t see it used that much, and many times, you would not get enough interested people to join you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides Discord and the thoughtful organization of the channels, there were virtual Zoom rooms you could join throughout the conference. You were given a map with all the rooms, and it showed you who was in the given room; if your Zoom name and Discord name matched to a certain degree, it even showed your avatar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly on, someone started a \u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15yh9gABz2ZgHwbkOD5cXxgT_RQx7-ituTVy6dIQ11DM/edit#gid=1100664741\"\u003eSpreadsheet Party\u003c/a\u003e and it was a huge success; it was even turned into an \u003ca href=\"https://unleashed-simplistic-lingonberry.glitch.me/\"\u003eeditable Glitch page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe broadcast itself overall went well; there were some early glitches, sound issues and such, but these are almost inevitable. Cindy from Confreaks did a great job with everything. After some people suggested it, the organizers started adding some padding between talks, because people needed time to mentally move on to the next talk and Discord channel. It\u0026rsquo;d be nice to have a dedicated emcee next year, though; I\u0026rsquo;ve seen that work very well on other virtual conferences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll this culminated in the fact that throughout the weekend, I really felt like \u003cem\u003eI was there at the conference\u003c/em\u003e and that was a first for me with a virtual event. I\u0026rsquo;d be on Discord, have the livestream open (or up on my TV), chat/talk/zoom with people in the breaks, clap at the end of each talk and so on. It was like magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the many, many strengths of !!Con is that the organizers are really good at curating interesting talks. Even the ones where you go \u0026ldquo;meh\u0026rdquo; are still objectively good ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis year was no different, and I wanted to highlight a few that I enjoyed the most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z670kHQhYvs\"\u003efirst day\u0026rsquo;s keynote by Taeyoon Choi\u003c/a\u003e was one of the many talks that showed how you can be creative with pre-recorded talks; they don\u0026rsquo;t have to be just you speaking with a slide deck (not that anything is wrong with that).

I am shamelessly copying [Kottke's format](https://kottke.org/19/06/my-recent-media-diet-summer-solstice-2019-edition), with some minor changes. It was a very strong month for TV shows, with **Never Have I Ever, Normal People and The Great being its highlights.**\n\n---\n\n# Anime\n\n[Weathering with You (Tenki No Ko, 2019)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weathering_with_You): I've long been waiting to watch this and had high hopes for it, as it was created by [Makoto Shinkai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makoto_Shinkai) who also made one of my favorite animes ever, [Your Name (Kimi no Na wa)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Name). The animation is gorgeous, but the story left me sorely disappointed and I bailed halfway through.\n\n# Movies\n\n[Popstar: Never Stop Stopping (2016)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3960412/): This was loads of fun. Way more fun than I expected. I already liked Lonely Island so I shouldn't have been surprised. Anyways, I loved it. It's the [This Is Spinal Tap](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088258/) of the 2010s. (A)\n\n[The Losers (2010)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480255/): Very dumb, but also, mostly very fun. (B)\n\n[The Lovebirds (2020)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8851668/): This was fun. I mostly background watched it, but I did focus more when it was necessary and in the final 30 minutes or so. There is nothing special about this movie, but there are worse ways to spend 90 minutes. (B-)\n\n# Background watch\n\nNew section! I started doing jigsaw puzzles, and I needed something to play in the background and/or during work. These are the ones I've seen so far. I'm probably not going to give these a proper rating.\n\n[Star Trek II (1982)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084726/), [III (1984)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088170/) and [IV (1986)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092007/): These were okay, I guess. It's been a long while since I watch them. It's startling just how much the Klingons are a stand-in for the Soviets. The highlight of these is definitely the 4th movie.\n\n[Star Trek: Voyager (season 4, episode 25 \"One\")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_(Star_Trek:_Voyager)): I try not to watch too much pandemic-related content, but I felt the urge to rewatch this in the background, and it was pretty good.\n\n[The Death of Stalin (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4686844/): Meh. I barely paid attention.\n\n[Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy (2011)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1340800/): I couldn't even get through it as a background watch.\n\n[Top Gun (1986)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092099/): Ok so the thing is, in 2020, Top Gun reads like a parody of itself. The dialog is so incredibly cheesy and over-the-top that it is nigh impossible to take the movie seriously. I'm still excited about the coming sequel, though.\n\n# TV shows\n\n[Billions (season 5, episodes 1-4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billions_(TV_series)): This show has long reached its natural endpoint and now it's just a soap opera disguised as prestige television.

I might finish it. Or not.\n\n[Westworld (season 3, episode 8)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(TV_series)): Yeah, this sucked. The whole season was terrible.

Then get a list of the people you follow and pipe it into a text file: `t followings \u003e ~/my_followings.txt`, which you'll use to add everyone to your list: `cat ~/my_followings.txt|xargs t list add Unfiltered`. You can also do this with just one command, as you might have deducted.\n\nAnd that's it! You now have both a heavily filtered timeline that keeps you mostly sane, but also the ability to check it out without any of those filters, if you wish to.\n\nThe only thing you have to keep in mind now is **whenever you follow or unfollow someone, you'll have to add or remove them to/from your Unfiltered Twitter list as well**. I find that to be a small price to pay, personally.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWednesday, 11 Mar 2020\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2020/03/11/how-to-stay-sane-on-twitter-dot-com/\n\nMore about...\n\n* twitter:      https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/twitter/\n* sanity:       https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/sanity/\n* mentalhealth: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/mentalhealth/"

It\u0026rsquo;s a great Richard Curtis movie (the guy who made Love Actually and About Time, for example.) How you feel about this will largely depend on how you feel about his other movies, and that\u0026rsquo;s all I\u0026rsquo;m going to say. I loved it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wag_the_Dog\"\u003eWag the Dog\u003c/a\u003e: A great black comedy in itself, but it becomes legendary once you watch it and learn that it was released a month before the Monica Lewinsky scandal, which makes it downright prophetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6332276/\"\u003eWhat We Left Behind:  Looking Back at Deep Space Nine\u003c/a\u003e: I love Star Trek: Deep Space 9 and despite its faults, this documentary is a must-watch for anyone who\u0026rsquo;s a fan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098635/\"\u003eWhen Harry Met Sally\u0026hellip;\u003c/a\u003e: Arguable the OG romcom of the modern era, that still holds up 30 years later.

First is a top 20 of things I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in 2019 and was released this year and/or it had a season released this year:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80211627\"\u003eRussian Doll (season 1)\u003c/a\u003e: An amazing show about trauma, connection, growing and so many other things. \u003ca href=\"https://writetogether.space/posts/ktamas/russian-doll-spoilers\"\u003eI wrote about it in detail with spoilers here\u003c/a\u003e.

Yes, I\u0026rsquo;m repeating myself. There are so many parallels between TEOTFW and Russian Doll, even though they are very different; I love them both and I thought about it a lot and I can\u0026rsquo;t decide which one would deserve the first place this is only in second place because markdown is stupid. This show managed to pull off a second season that\u0026rsquo;s possibly better than the first one; one I didn\u0026rsquo;t think it needed a second season the first place. \u003ca href=\"https://writetogether.space/posts/ktamas/the-end-of-the-fucking-world\"\u003eI wrote about it a bit more without spoilers here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleabag\"\u003eFleabag (seasons 1 and 2)\u003c/a\u003e: Everything Phoebe Waller-Bridge touches turns to gold, and this is no exception.

That\u0026rsquo;s precisely what happened to The OA which was by far the most mind-bending thing I\u0026rsquo;ve seen this year. It\u0026rsquo;s gonna fuck with your head and then fuck with it a lot more, and you\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy it. And then it\u0026rsquo;s canceled because fuck Netflix.

The first season is extremely solid already, but the second one is one of the best seasons ever created in the history of television. The show is very overwhelming emotionally; I ugly-cried after the season 2 finale. But it was totally worth it. Season three is a mixed bag, and part of things the whole thing would have been better off being canceled after the second one. But it wraps things up in a way that\u0026rsquo;s very on-brand for The Leftovers and is ultimately worth watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crashing_(British_TV_series)\"\u003eCrashing (miniseries)\u003c/a\u003e: A quick, funny show from Phobe Waller-Bridge from 2016.

It\u0026rsquo;s complex with a great ensemble of characters. The writing is very uneven but I can\u0026rsquo;t help but love the show. It\u0026rsquo;s very different from what one\u0026rsquo;s used to with Western television.

Each season has a different feel to it; my favorite is probably the first one, but the second one was pretty great too. It gets uneven oftentimes, and some characters are criminally underused (particularly her daughter). I stopped watching the third season after a few episodes because it was too horror-ey for me.

Looking back, things really started going off rails after they ran out of the books after season 5, but I think everyone kept making excuses for the show — including me — and hoped that the final season will be a worthy payoff. So much for that. We did get like two goodish episodes (the first two) but the rest is just, \u003cem\u003eugh\u003c/em\u003e. So bad. Not to mention you couldn\u0026rsquo;t see shit during the dark scenes and then they kept doubling down on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/See_(TV_series)\"\u003eSee (season 1)\u003c/a\u003e: This show was never good to begin with, even though it had a really strong and unique concept. Any sort of hope I had after the first three episodes that things would get better got quickly disproved and it just kept going downhill. A shame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)\"\u003eThe Expanse (season 4)\u003c/a\u003e: Much of this was table setting for Season 5 — which is happening — with frustrating storylines, characters acting out of character and a very one-dimensional villain.

			"content_text": "I've been blogging about the things I've been watching almost all year ([here's the latest one, with links to all previous installments](https://writetogether.space/posts/ktamas/my-recent-media-diet-dec-2019)). As part of looking back at this year, below is a list of movies and TV shows I've enjoyed the most this year. Media that was released earlier but seen in 2019 and rewatches count as well. My post, my rules. Settle in; this will take a while. But it'll be worth it.\n\n# Movies\n\nI can't really rank these because they are so diverse, so these are in just alphabetical order. They're all great in their own ways and you should watch them.\n\n[Booksmart](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1489887/): The funny and smart teen movie of the year. I have some extremely minor gripes with it, but overall, I loved it.\n\n[Cruel Intentions](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139134/): You couldn't make this movie in 2019 for many reasons that become immediately obvious once you've seen it, so thank god they made it 20 years earlier. Pitch black teen comedy / drama, with great leads and a killer soundtrack. I loved almost everything about it.\n\n[Fast Color](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6418778/): An amazing superhero movie unlike any other, that is criminally unknown. Gives me hope that that this genre can contain multitudes.\n\n[Free Solo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7775622/): One of the best documentaries I've seen in 2019, hands down.\n\n[General Magic](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6849786/): The other great documentary this year about the company you probably didn't know about and yet influenced all the computing devices and gadgets you have today.\n\n[Good Boys](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7343762/): This was my laughing-out-loud-during-the-whole-time movie this year. It's fucking hilarious with some really smart writing.\n\n[Long Shot](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2139881/): I guess this is more of an honorable mention, but really, who would have thought that Seth Rogen could make a smart and raunchy comedy in 2019? That's good? Not me. And yet. It's good.\n\n[Spotlight](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1895587/): A great movie about journalists doing their jobs and being great at it. Pure competence porn. Proves that you can make Oscar-bait but also make it actually good.\n\n[Toy Story 4](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1979376/): I really didn't expect this to be one of my favorite movies this year but here we are. Possible the best one in the series. But like, Disney, don't tempt fate by trying to make a fifth one.\n\n[Yesterday](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8079248/): I almost passed on this, and then watched it one day anyway and was so pleasantly surprised. It's a great Richard Curtis movie (the guy who made Love Actually and About Time, for example.) How you feel about this will largely depend on how you feel about his other movies, and that's all I'm going to say. I loved it. \n\n[Wag the Dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wag_the_Dog): A great black comedy in itself, but it becomes legendary once you watch it and learn that it was released a month before the Monica Lewinsky scandal, which makes it downright prophetic.\n\n[What We Left Behind:  Looking Back at Deep Space Nine](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6332276/): I love Star Trek: Deep Space 9 and despite its faults, this documentary is a must-watch for anyone who's a fan.\n\n[When Harry Met Sally...](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098635/): Arguable the OG romcom of the modern era, that still holds up 30 years later. Billy Crystal, Meg Ryan, Nora Ephron, Rob Reiner — they are all great individually, but all of them together made something special.\n\n# Anime\n\nI didn't watch much anime at all this year. I tried out a couple of shows but never got into them. That being said I did a rewatch of [Kimi No Na Wa](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5311514/) and it's still a great movie.\n\n# TV shows\n\nOkay, so I'll break this down into a couple of lists, because boy did I watch a LOT of television this year. First is a top 20 of things I've seen in 2019 and was released this year and/or it had a season released this year:\n\n1. [Russian Doll (season 1)](https://www.netflix.com/title/80211627): An amazing show about trauma, connection, growing and so many other things. [I wrote about it in detail with spoilers here](https://writetogether.space/posts/ktamas/russian-doll-spoilers). The second season is coming and I'm both excited and worried about it, but I think trust its creators enough not to fuck that up.\n2. [The End of the Fucking World (season 2)](https://www.netflix.com/title/80175722): An amazing show about trauma, connection, growing and so many other things. Yes, I'm repeating myself. There are so many parallels between TEOTFW and Russian Doll, even though they are very different; I love them both and I thought about it a lot and I can't decide which one would deserve the first place this is only in second place because markdown is stupid. This show managed to pull off a second season that's possibly better than the first one; one I didn't think it needed a second season the first place. [I wrote about it a bit more without spoilers here](https://writetogether.space/posts/ktamas/the-end-of-the-fucking-world).\n3. [Fleabag (seasons 1 and 2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleabag): Everything Phoebe Waller-Bridge touches turns to gold, and this is no exception. Another show about, yes, you know it, trauma, connection, growing and so many other things. So fucking good in every possible way.\n4. [The OA (seasons 1 and 2)](https://www.netflix.com/title/80044950): Hey did you know that [Netflix's business strategy is canceling shows after two, or, at best, three seasons](https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-cancels-many-tv-shows-after-2-or-3-seasons-report-2019-4)? That's precisely what happened to The OA which was by far the most mind-bending thing I've seen this year. It's gonna fuck with your head and then fuck with it a lot more, and you'll enjoy it. And then it's canceled because fuck Netflix. It's still worth watching, though.\n5. [You're The Worst (season 5)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27re_the_Worst): The final season of the best American fucked up couple on television. I'm still mad at its creators for mercilessly toying with my feelings until almost the last second, but it pays off tremendously. They pulled off a perfect ending, in every possible way. Kudos.\n6. [Chernobyl (miniseries)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_(miniseries)): It's brutal. You know from the start it's not gonna end well. You know history (at least the basics). And yet, it's five hours of great television, created by [the guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Mazin) who wrote \\*checks notes\\* The Hangover 2 and 3. People truly contain multitudes.\n7. [Catastrophe (season 4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophe_(2015_TV_series)): The very likely final season of the best half-American, half-Irish fucked up couple on television. In each season the show got better and better and it ended on a high note. \n8. [Bonding (season 1)](https://www.netflix.com/title/81004814): Short and sweet and heartwarming and funny, not at all what you'd expect at first. I really hope it somehow gets another season.\n9. [Succession (season 2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)): Part of me wanted to rank this higher but there were so many other good things this year. Still, the sophomore season of Succession was a great watch. Team Shiv for life.\n10. [The Morning Show (season 1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morning_Show_(American_TV_series)): I've said this many times and I'll say it again. Is this a good show? Eh, not really. Is it an entertaining show? with a few exceptions, *extremely*. And that's why I love it.\n11. [Euphoria (season 1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)): This gave me all the feels, in many ways. I loved it, but I am worried if they can keep up the quality of the show. We'll see next year.\n12. [High Maintenance (season 3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Maintenance): This show about the nameless weed delivery guy in New York started on Vimeo and eventually migrated to HBO. It delivers consistently great episodes with very human stories. In its latest season, the protagonist plays a slightly more prominent role than usual, but not to the detriment of the rest. I hope they'll keep going for many more seasons. \n13. [The Mandalorian (season 1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian): If I put aside the fact that Baby Yoda is extremely cute — and he really is — there were only three episodes I liked this season (4, 6, 8). But those three were genuinely good and the last one makes me excited about what's coming next.\n14. [Star Trek: Discovery (season 2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Discovery): Woo boy, this was a mess, especially when they change showrunners mid-season. It was, however, pretty good overall, and it's still the best second season any Star Trek show ever produced, with the possible exception of DS9.\n15. [Easy (seasons 1-3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_(TV_series)): Loosely connected stories of people in various stages of life and love in Chicago, done really well. I liked it a lot.\n16. [Tales of the City (2019 miniseries)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_the_City_(2019_miniseries)): So I watched this without even really knowing the previous series existed, but I still enjoyed it a lot. It's a mess, but a very lovable mess.\n17. [Unbelievable (miniseries)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbelievable_(miniseries)): This is an emotionally hard watch, especially the first two episodes, but it's worth it. Great leads and a good story.\n18. [When They See Us (miniseries)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_They_See_Us): The other hard watch; even if you know the story and know how it ends, it's still brutal.\n19. [The Good Place (season 4, eps 1-9)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Place): This only gets on this list because of episode 8 and 9. The latter is a masterpiece that made me cry. But why did I have to suffer through 7 mediocre-at-best episodes first?\n20. [Silicon Valley (season 6)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)): This show overstayed its welcome and the final season was uneven and mostly forgettable — except the series finale, which was really well done and very satisfying, so it gets to be on this list.\n\n---\n\nA few more honorable mentions from this year: \n\n[Broad City (season 5)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_City): I feel like Broad City also overstayed its welcome but its final season was still pretty good. \n\n[Sex Education (season 1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Education_(TV_series)): This was pretty good, I just couldn't find a place for it among all the other good shows. Season 2 is coming really soon.\n\n[Counterpart (season 2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpart_(TV_series)): The second season was uneven, even though the actors and the characters were great; but the writing didn't quite live up to it. It got canceled, but it does have an ending.\n\n[Killing Eve (seasons 1 and 2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Eve): Look, the first season is almost a masterpiece; Phoebe Waller-Bridge was the showrunner and was involved heavily otherwise, and both Jodie Comer and Sandra Oh are great leads. But the quality drops sharply in season 2 and it ends in a way that undermines a lot of things it was building up towards which just pissed me off. I'll still watch the next season; maybe it improves again.\n\n---\n\nThe show that I never rank but I love: [Patriot Act](https://www.netflix.com/title/80239931) which is always great, the best news entertainment show on TV right now. Check out the [Deep Cuts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE6linSnhLs377HnPjCNKbSezvRjLHg0k) on Youtube as well.\n\n---\n\nStill with me? I've got a few more shows that I watched this year but were released earlier.\n\n[The Leftovers (seasons 1-3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leftovers_(TV_series)): I could write several pages about this show. The first season is extremely solid already, but the second one is one of the best seasons ever created in the history of television. The show is very overwhelming emotionally; I ugly-cried after the season 2 finale. But it was totally worth it. Season three is a mixed bag, and part of things the whole thing would have been better off being canceled after the second one. But it wraps things up in a way that's very on-brand for The Leftovers and is ultimately worth watching. \n\n[Crashing (miniseries)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crashing_(British_TV_series)): A quick, funny show from Phobe Waller-Bridge from 2016. It should be binged in one sitting and you'll be very satisfied.\n\n[Schtisel (seasons 1 and 2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shtisel): This Israeli show was created a few years ago but it really blew up this year when Netflix picked it up. It's complex with a great ensemble of characters. The writing is very uneven but I can't help but love the show. It's very different from what one's used to with Western television. Thanks to its newfound popularity, a third season is now in the works.\n\n[Goliath (seasons 1-3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliath_(TV_series)): Billy Bob Thornton plays a mostly-high-functioning alcoholic down-on-his-luck lawyer, and he plays him brilliantly. Each season has a different feel to it; my favorite is probably the first one, but the second one was pretty great too. It gets uneven oftentimes, and some characters are criminally underused (particularly her daughter). I stopped watching the third season after a few episodes because it was too horror-ey for me. It's coming back for its final season sometime in the future; I'll check it out.\n\n---\n\nAnd finally, the greatest disappointments of the year in no particular order (but I'll definitely start with GoT first):\n\n[Game of Thrones (season 8)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones): I mean. Looking back, things really started going off rails after they ran out of the books after season 5, but I think everyone kept making excuses for the show — including me — and hoped that the final season will be a worthy payoff. So much for that. We did get like two goodish episodes (the first two) but the rest is just, *ugh*. So bad. Not to mention you couldn't see shit during the dark scenes and then they kept doubling down on that.\n\n[See (season 1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/See_(TV_series)): This show was never good to begin with, even though it had a really strong and unique concept. Any sort of hope I had after the first three episodes that things would get better got quickly disproved and it just kept going downhill. A shame.\n\n[The Expanse (season 4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)): Much of this was table setting for Season 5 — which is happening — with frustrating storylines, characters acting out of character and a very one-dimensional villain. I hope they do better next year.\n\n[The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (season 3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marvelous_Mrs._Maisel): Yet another show with a season that was all over the place. It had its good parts but a fair amount was less than stellar. And then they shit the bed in the final 15 minutes. I don't have high hopes for the next season, but I'll check it out.\n\n[The Magicians (season 4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magicians_(American_TV_series)): It was an uneven season but I will never get past the season finale and what they did there. It feels off and it feels wrong and it still makes me angry.\n\n[Veronica Mars (season 4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_Mars): Ugh, yikes. This season was already weak and then they made things a whole lot worse in the final episode. Shouldn't have been surprised given that the movie was not great either.\n\n---\n\nIf you're still reading, thank you and I salute you; please leave a comment so I know there are people who appreciate 2380 words about stuff I watch. This was a good year for movies but an especially great one for television. We'll see how 2020 will go.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThursday, 2 Jan 2020\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2020/01/02/best-of-media-2019/\n\nMore about...\n\n* thoughts:        https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/thoughts/\n* mediadiet:       https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/mediadiet/\n* recommendations: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/recommendations/"

Rey faces her dark side in a Return of the Jedi way for, uh, half a minute and then moves on? What was that about? Ben has a change of heart because Leia reaches out to him, but, like, couldn\u0026rsquo;t she have done it, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, sooner?

Despite that, I had an overall amazing time at XOXO and for most of it, I managed to forget at least some of my worries and focus on spending time with all the amazing people in this community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got to spend time with a lot of amazing people, have great conversations, heard a bunch of good conference talks, watched great performances at Story and so much more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got to work on a couple of projects which I thoroughly enjoyed and others did too — my portraits and the prints of them, the XOXO bingo and the XOXO calendar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the third XOXO I\u0026rsquo;ve been to and it was decidedly the best one. The festival gets refined every year, and it shows. There really isn\u0026rsquo;t anything I can complain about except to suggest having more Karaoke next year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope to be back — the lottery willing — in 2020 as well. The XOXO community means so much to me: it\u0026rsquo;s an important part of my online, and for a small time of a year, offline social life, full of people I love spending time with (and they seem to like me too?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXOXO gives me a special feeling: the feeling of \u0026ldquo;finding my people\u0026rdquo;.

Despite that, I had an overall amazing time at XOXO and for most of it, I managed to forget at least some of my worries and focus on spending time with all the amazing people in this community.\n\nI got to spend time with a lot of amazing people, have great conversations, heard a bunch of good conference talks, watched great performances at Story and so much more.\n\nI got to work on a couple of projects which I thoroughly enjoyed and others did too — my portraits and the prints of them, the XOXO bingo and the XOXO calendar.\n\nThis was the third XOXO I've been to and it was decidedly the best one. The festival gets refined every year, and it shows. There really isn't anything I can complain about except to suggest having more Karaoke next year.\n\nI hope to be back — the lottery willing — in 2020 as well. The XOXO community means so much to me: it's an important part of my online, and for a small time of a year, offline social life, full of people I love spending time with (and they seem to like me too?)\n\nXOXO gives me a special feeling: the feeling of \"finding my people\". It just sucks that most of the people I want to hang out and spend time with live so far away.\n\n---\n\nTo close things up, here is a non-exhaustive list of people and things I'm grateful for.\n\n[Sarah](https://twitter.com/fledglingnerd), thank you for telling me that \"XOXO doesn't start for me until I see you\". I love you and you are the best XOXO mom and person I know. Thank you for the karaoke as well.\n\n[Josh](https://twitter.com/joshmillard) and [Angela](https://twitter.com/angelapiller), thank you for being my friends, I always enjoy hanging with you, and I wish we could do it more often.\n\n[Julia](https://twitter.com/juliaskott) and [Riley](https://twitter.com/rileyjshaw), it was fun working with you on the bingo, let's do it again next year.\n\n[Emory](https://twitter.com/emorydunn), it was fun traveling with you; I hope we get to do that again.\n\n[Jonah](https://twitter.com/jonahedwards), it was great to finally meet, hang out and talk shop about infrastructure/sysadmin things, which I don't get to do very often.\n\nEveryone who came to that #ptsd meetup; it meant a lot to me.\n\n[Becky](https://twitter.com/bookymargoof), [Josh May](https://twitter.com/notjosh), [Eliza](https://twitter.com/gravitytrope), [Juan](https://twitter.com/juanbuis), Crystal, Dan, [Lyndsey](https://twitter.com/lyyyndseyyy), [Joel](https://twitter.com/notdetails), [Joshua Blunt](https://twitter.com/stickwithjosh), [Danielle](https://twitter.com/djbaskin), [Liene](https://twitter.com/li3n3), [Earl](https://twitter.com/theearlcarlson), [Skyler](https://twitter.com/hello_skyler), [Jonathan](https://twitter.com/jwegener), [Dunja](https://twitter.com/dunjalazic), [Robert](https://twitter.com/fonorobert), [Dylan](https://twitter.com/dylanw), [Tina](https://twitter.com/spongefile), [Vale](https://twitter.com/EssentialRandom), [Doug](https://twitter.com/doug_hanke), [Jim](https://twitter.com/jwithy) and all the other people I got to hang out with, thank you for your company and often your kind words. They mean a lot to me.\n\nAnd finally, [Andy](https://twitter.com/andymcmillan), [Andy](https://twitter.com/waxpancake), Rachel, everyone else on the production team and all the volunteers, thank you for making XOXO an amazing experience for us.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThursday, 17 Oct 2019\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/10/17/xoxo-2019-closing-thoughts-and-gratitude/\n\nMore about...\n\n* xoxo: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/xoxo/"

The last few days have been eventful, and I was started getting sad about it being the last day of XOXO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got to Rev Hall short after 11. I got Pip\u0026rsquo;s for breakfast; I joined \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/DunjaLazic\"\u003eDunja\u003c/a\u003e and some of her friends who offered me a scone with a jam made from a local berry; I think it might have been marionberry. In any case, it was really tasty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/thelindsayellis\"\u003eLindsay Ellis\u0026rsquo;\u003c/a\u003e talk, then went back to the park to hang out with \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/djbaskin\"\u003eDanielle\u003c/a\u003e who makes the app \u003ca href=\"https://dialup.com\"\u003eDialup\u003c/a\u003e. It has groups (\u0026ldquo;lines\u0026rdquo;) you can join which have usually one call scheduled a week and it connects you with a random person in that group. I\u0026rsquo;m a huge fan of the app and I was already part of the XOXO line; I had a good call with \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/li3n3\"\u003eLiene\u003c/a\u003e a few weeks before the festival. I also ran into \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/backlon\"\u003eDieter\u003c/a\u003e (who writes for The Verge) and his wife \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Adora\"\u003eLisa\u003c/a\u003e at the same time. We had a great conversation; Danielle also gave us one of her cool custom floppy business cards and talked about how she found random old data on them when buying them from eBay, stuff like someone\u0026rsquo;s old thesis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran into \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/emorydunn\"\u003eEmory\u003c/a\u003e again who was sitting next to Jessica; she organized a really cool pre-xoxo party in 2018. We talked quite a bit about mental health and different medications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it started pouring rain and we all ran back to Rev Hall. I gave Lyndsey back a couple of her things I was safekeeping from the day before; I also ran into \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/dylanw\"\u003eDylan\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/maxisnow\"\u003eMax\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/fledglingnerd\"\u003eSarah\u003c/a\u003e in the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to Martha\u0026rsquo;s to get my daily writing done, then had a really good chat with \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/jonahedwards\"\u003eJonah\u003c/a\u003e about all things infrastructure, trading all kinds of war stories and geeking out over the stuff I don\u0026rsquo;t usually get to with people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back to watch the last two talks; \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/the_jennitaur\"\u003eJenny Odell\u0026rsquo;s\u003c/a\u003e was okay I guess — it didn\u0026rsquo;t say anything new if you\u0026rsquo;ve been following her — and also listened to \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/RheaButcher\"\u003eRhea Butcher\u003c/a\u003e doing standup which fell really flat for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe closing address was great as usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went for dinner to a nearby pub with Sarah, Dylan, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/potentato\"\u003eTim\u003c/a\u003e and someone else, but the place had literally nothing I could eat so I took a Lyft back to Rev Hall. I started saying goodbye to a few people, since I didn\u0026rsquo;t know if we\u0026rsquo;d meet again at the closing party or the next day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had dinner in the Show Bar, went by the Karaoke place but they were still setting things up. I made the mistake of not getting my name on the list right then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at the bar, I watched a bit of the interactive album debut of \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/neilcic\"\u003eNeil Cicierega\u003c/a\u003e in which you could post things in a Slack channel and it would show up on the projector. It was pretty cool though I could barely hear any of the music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe highlight of the day was, of course, the Karaoke by Baby Ketten: there were so many good performances, by \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Mike_Eagle\"\u003eOpen Mike Eagle\u003c/a\u003e, Lindsay Ellis, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/electrolemon\"\u003eDemi Adejuyigbe\u003c/a\u003e and a lot more people I forget right now. \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/notdetails\"\u003eJoel\u003c/a\u003e closed up the evening with Ghostbusters. I was on the list, but like a lot of other people, didn\u0026rsquo;t get to sing, which kind of sucked; I was really set on doing karaoke at XOXO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot wanting the evening to end also wanting to do karaoke, a bunch of us went to Baby Ketten\u0026rsquo;s newly opened bar with Sarah, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/jwithy\"\u003eJim\u003c/a\u003e and someone else; the place slowly filled up with more XOXOers. I got to see \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/kevinmarks\"\u003eKevin\u003c/a\u003e sing Common People; both Jim and Sarah sang Pet Shop Boys songs, while I ended up opting for — after changing my mind several times — Sweet Child of Mine, which was\u0026hellip; a bit too ambitious in retrospect, but I did my best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lVlFQTe.jpg\" alt=\"karaoke\"\u003e\nLet this blurry image be enough.

The last few days have been eventful, and I was started getting sad about it being the last day of XOXO.\n\nI got to Rev Hall short after 11. I got Pip's for breakfast; I joined [Dunja](https://twitter.com/DunjaLazic) and some of her friends who offered me a scone with a jam made from a local berry; I think it might have been marionberry. In any case, it was really tasty.\n\nI caught [Lindsay Ellis'](https://twitter.com/thelindsayellis) talk, then went back to the park to hang out with [Danielle](https://twitter.com/djbaskin) who makes the app [Dialup](https://dialup.com). It has groups (\"lines\") you can join which have usually one call scheduled a week and it connects you with a random person in that group. I'm a huge fan of the app and I was already part of the XOXO line; I had a good call with [Liene](https://twitter.com/li3n3) a few weeks before the festival. I also ran into [Dieter](https://twitter.com/backlon) (who writes for The Verge) and his wife [Lisa](https://twitter.com/Adora) at the same time. We had a great conversation; Danielle also gave us one of her cool custom floppy business cards and talked about how she found random old data on them when buying them from eBay, stuff like someone's old thesis.\n\nI ran into [Emory](https://twitter.com/emorydunn) again who was sitting next to Jessica; she organized a really cool pre-xoxo party in 2018. We talked quite a bit about mental health and different medications.\n\nAnd then it started pouring rain and we all ran back to Rev Hall. I gave Lyndsey back a couple of her things I was safekeeping from the day before; I also ran into [Dylan](https://twitter.com/dylanw), [Max](https://twitter.com/maxisnow) and [Sarah](https://twitter.com/fledglingnerd) in the bar.\n\nI went to Martha's to get my daily writing done, then had a really good chat with [Jonah](https://twitter.com/jonahedwards) about all things infrastructure, trading all kinds of war stories and geeking out over the stuff I don't usually get to with people.\n\nI went back to watch the last two talks; [Jenny Odell's](https://twitter.com/the_jennitaur) was okay I guess — it didn't say anything new if you've been following her — and also listened to [Rhea Butcher](https://twitter.com/RheaButcher) doing standup which fell really flat for me.\n\nThe closing address was great as usual.\n\nI went for dinner to a nearby pub with Sarah, Dylan, [Tim](https://twitter.com/potentato) and someone else, but the place had literally nothing I could eat so I took a Lyft back to Rev Hall. I started saying goodbye to a few people, since I didn't know if we'd meet again at the closing party or the next day.\n\nI had dinner in the Show Bar, went by the Karaoke place but they were still setting things up. I made the mistake of not getting my name on the list right then.\n\nBack at the bar, I watched a bit of the interactive album debut of [Neil Cicierega](https://twitter.com/neilcic) in which you could post things in a Slack channel and it would show up on the projector. It was pretty cool though I could barely hear any of the music.\n\nThe highlight of the day was, of course, the Karaoke by Baby Ketten: there were so many good performances, by [Open Mike Eagle](https://twitter.com/Mike_Eagle), Lindsay Ellis, [Demi Adejuyigbe](https://twitter.com/electrolemon) and a lot more people I forget right now. [Joel](https://twitter.com/notdetails) closed up the evening with Ghostbusters. I was on the list, but like a lot of other people, didn't get to sing, which kind of sucked; I was really set on doing karaoke at XOXO.\n\nNot wanting the evening to end also wanting to do karaoke, a bunch of us went to Baby Ketten's newly opened bar with Sarah, [Jim](https://twitter.com/jwithy) and someone else; the place slowly filled up with more XOXOers. I got to see [Kevin](https://twitter.com/kevinmarks) sing Common People; both Jim and Sarah sang Pet Shop Boys songs, while I ended up opting for — after changing my mind several times — Sweet Child of Mine, which was... a bit too ambitious in retrospect, but I did my best.\n\n![karaoke](https://i.imgur.com/lVlFQTe.jpg)\nLet this blurry image be enough. I have a video of my full performance but I can't bring myself to watch it.\n\nBy then it was 1 am or so, and I was getting tired. I said goodbye to Sarah who told me a few more kind words and went back to my Airbnb. I was profoundly sad that XOXO was over; but as learned the next day, it really wasn't just yet.\n\n*(A postscript: a few days after a festival, someone posted on the slack about PSB's new album, and one thing led to another and now I'm going to a PSB arena concert in London next May with a bunch of XOXO people.)*\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTuesday, 15 Oct 2019\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/10/15/xoxo-2019-part-7/\n\nMore about...\n\n* xoxo: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/xoxo/"

I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the last time I laughed that much listening to — well, watching — a podcast. They talked about the Ghostbusters theme song which turned into an in-joke for the rest of the conference.

I also met F6x and got to thank him for the help he gives us.\n\n![beckyandjosh](https://i.imgur.com/DgeTlBr.jpg)\n[Becky](https://twitter.com/bookymargoof) and [Josh](https://twitter.com/notjosh)\n\n![emoryeliza](https://i.imgur.com/khgLIO0.jpg)\n[Emory](https://twitter.com/emorydunn) and [Eliza](https://twitter.com/gravitytrope)\n\n![lyndsey](https://i.imgur.com/mkRbJxJ.jpg)\n[Lyndsey](https://twitter.com/lyyyndseyyy)\n\n![sarah](https://i.imgur.com/2VcRKRU.jpg)\n[Sarah](https://twitter.com/fledglingnerd)\n\nAround 2 pm, we did an encore of Tim Tam Slam Jam, showing more people this now-tradition. Afterwards I got to chat a bit with [Michael Hobbs](https://twitter.com/RottenInDenmark) and [Sarah Marshall](https://twitter.com/Remember_Sarah), hosts of one of my favorite podcast, [You're wrong about...](https://twitter.com/yourewrongabout) Michael also tried slamming and liked it a lot. I also took their picture.\n\nIn the afternoon, I watched most of the talks: a couple of them were okay, the one that really stood out for me was by [Hundred Rabbits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW32yUEymvU); they talked about sailing around the world and all the challenges that come with that. \n\nAfter the conference ended, I headed to Martha's for a break where I ran into [Doug Hanke](https://twitter.com/doug_hanke). We talked like an hour about various life stuff and it was just a really great and meaningful conversation. \n\nBefore Story, I had a good chat with Elina Levkovskaya about fashion, and got to tell [Matthew Bogart](https://twitter.com/MatthewBogart) that I love [Incredible Doom](https://www.incredibledoom.com/) (I should finish reading it, now that the entire first volume is up online.)\n\nI got a front seat for Story that started with You're Wrong About. They talked about the [Janet Jackson Superbowl Halftime Controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVIII_halftime_show_controversy) and it was really great to see them live. This was followed by [Everything is Alive](https://www.everythingisalive.com/) that interviewed a chainsaw; it was surprisingly entertaining. I took a small break to find my favorite tote bag that I managed to lose twice one day, then went back and caught most of  [Yo, is this racist?](https://www.earwolf.com/show/yo-is-this-racist/), where [Demi](https://twitter.com/electrolemon) and [Miel](https://twitter.com/miel) were guests. They had some really touching questions from the audience in the end.\n\nNext, [Helen Zaltzman](https://twitter.com/HelenZaltzman) talked about pronouns in a live production of [The Allusionist](https://twitter.com/AllusionistShow). The final show that night was arguably the best one: the last episode of [Punch up the Jam](https://twitter.com/punchupthejam) with Demi in it; they had [Neil Cicierega](https://twitter.com/neilcic) and [Open Mike Eagle](https://twitter.com/Mike_Eagle) for guests. The whole thing is up on Youtube and you should watch it; it's laugh-out-loud hilarious. I don't remember the last time I laughed that much listening to — well, watching — a podcast. They talked about the Ghostbusters theme song which turned into an in-joke for the rest of the conference. I even made a tribute page for it that lives at [ghostbuste.rs](https://ghostbuste.rs/).\n\n![r](https://i.imgur.com/wFjBQhw.jpg)\n\n![p](https://i.imgur.com/gI1db6y.jpg)\n\nThe day was not yet over; earlier that night I got invited to a house party by Juan, so that was my next stop. The party was great but loud and that's not my kind of thing so I ended up resting in a quieter room. [Jonah](https://twitter.com/jonahedwards) ordered a bunch of pizza us; he also gave me another 90s temporary tattoo and I got two more for the future: one \"Under Construction\" and another that says \"Sign My Guestbook.\"\n\nIt was at that party I got to talk with [Vale](https://twitter.com/EssentialRandom) — who's now a regular here at WriteTogether — about life, freelancing, 3D printing a fuck machine and she also showed her 3D-printed glow-in-the-dark Luigis on the cross with the Evangelion spear in their chest. I managed to get one of them in the form of a fridge magnet the next day. \n\nI got home around 2:15 am and went to sleep around 3. It was also the first day that I wore my new sneakers, and they were not really comfortable; ultimately it turned out they are just not a good fit at all.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMonday, 14 Oct 2019\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/10/14/xoxo-2019-part-6/\n\nMore about...\n\n* xoxo: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/xoxo/"

He showed [a video about calculating your pet's HP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jcxc-ddWKI\u0026list=PLaDrN74SfdT7Ueqtwn_bXo1MuSWT0ji2w\u0026index=17\u0026t=0s) and it was hilarious, well worth staying up late.\n\nThen I took a Lyft home, showered and went to sleep.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMonday, 30 Sep 2019\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/30/xoxo-2019-part-5/\n\nMore about...\n\n* xoxo: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/xoxo/"

I wanted to have a T-shirt with \u0026ldquo;Helvetica\u0026rdquo; in big, bold letters. Here, this is how it looks like:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/K2QibN6.jpg\" alt=\"Helvetica1\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s cool, right? At first, it\u0026rsquo;s nothing special. It\u0026rsquo;s just \u0026ldquo;Helvetica\u0026rdquo; in Helvetica. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/btVrpYH.jpg\" alt=\"Helvetica2\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, I zoomed in a bit. Can you see it yet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re just confused right now, seriously, good for you. If you\u0026rsquo;re a person who knows a thing or two about typography, however, your eyes might start twitching. That\u0026rsquo;s because the font here is Arial, and this T-shirt is designed to piss off a certain kind of font nerd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyways, it arrived the day before, so I decided it\u0026rsquo;s a good day to wear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day started with breakfast at Zell\u0026rsquo;s Cafe with Emory. The place was highly rated, but the food was somewhat disappointing: way too much cheese on my eggs, disappointing fries, bread that tasted weird. For dessert, we took scooters to Voodoo Donuts, which I still prefer over Blue Star, don\u0026rsquo;t @ me (we can all agree that Pip\u0026rsquo;s is excellent, though, right?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe wanted to check out the Panic sign since Emory has never seen it before.  I managed to lead us six blocks the wrong way, so Emory took over GPS duties for the rest of the trip. I kept getting/feeling slightly lost in Portland throughout my whole stay and couldn\u0026rsquo;t quite get a handle of the city — even though I\u0026rsquo;ve been there twice before. My stress and anxiety might have had something to do with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe did get to the Panic sign eventually, but as it turns out, it\u0026rsquo;s not much fun during daytime; you can barely see the colors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur next stop was the nearby Pendelton store, where I got not one but two coats for a redacted amount of money. They were beautiful coats, but I ended up returning both of them after the festival, as neither of them was quite the right cut for my weird body shape. If I\u0026rsquo;m spending that much money on a cloth item, they better be a good fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a break at Powell\u0026rsquo;s cafe, carefully not taking a look at the books because I have a giant backlog of them already. I did finally pick up \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/heartshapedsky\"\u003eAmy Baio\u0026rsquo;s\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://youthinkyouknowme.cards/\"\u003eYou Think You Know Me\u003c/a\u003e, though. It is, in a way, an investment in my future as I don\u0026rsquo;t have too many people I can play it with right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was around that time I connected with Dunja, Robert and Djordje, who arrived the day before; we met up in front of Revolution Hall just before 2 pm. I met Dunja at XOXO 2016; she was one of the few people from Eastern Europe. She introduced me to Robert in 2018, who\u0026rsquo;s also from Hungary; we hung out a bunch the past year. I haven\u0026rsquo;t met Djordje before; it was his first XOXO. He was Dunja\u0026rsquo;s friend from Serbia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw on Twitter that Andrew just got in town and was looking for something to do so I invited him along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked around the city, north on SE 13th St. then turned right on E Burnside St, wandering around and exploring the city for at least an hour. We ended up in Laurelhurst Park, which was pretty beautiful. After a short break, we each went our separate ways: Andrew to a museum, Dunja \u0026amp; co to get SIM cards and I walked to Belmont to get a late lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found a place called Straight From New York Pizza, and they had decent slices, though the New York part felt like a bit of a stretch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnticipating a high anxiety day as something triggered that the day before, I booked a massage at the Common Ground Wellness Co-op that someone recommended on the Slack. They were my next stop; I took a Lyft there. After checking in, I got undressed — the place is clothing optional — and had a great massage I really needed. Afterwards, I relaxed in their hot tub. It was a great place, and I would probably be a regular if I\u0026rsquo;d be living in Portland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce done, I took another Lyft back to APEX, for the now-traditional pre-XOXO Wednesday night beers. I got to have a great conversation with Andy McMillan, Jonah, Crystal, Dan and a few other people whose name escape me right now.

I wanted to have a T-shirt with \"Helvetica\" in big, bold letters. Here, this is how it looks like:\n\n![Helvetica1](https://i.imgur.com/K2QibN6.jpg)\n\nIt's cool, right? At first, it's nothing special. It's just \"Helvetica\" in Helvetica. Right?\n\n![Helvetica2](https://i.imgur.com/btVrpYH.jpg)\n\nThere, I zoomed in a bit. Can you see it yet?\n\nIf you're just confused right now, seriously, good for you. If you're a person who knows a thing or two about typography, however, your eyes might start twitching. That's because the font here is Arial, and this T-shirt is designed to piss off a certain kind of font nerd.\n\nAnyways, it arrived the day before, so I decided it's a good day to wear it.\n\n---\n\nThe day started with breakfast at Zell's Cafe with Emory. The place was highly rated, but the food was somewhat disappointing: way too much cheese on my eggs, disappointing fries, bread that tasted weird. For dessert, we took scooters to Voodoo Donuts, which I still prefer over Blue Star, don't @ me (we can all agree that Pip's is excellent, though, right?)\n\nWe wanted to check out the Panic sign since Emory has never seen it before.  I managed to lead us six blocks the wrong way, so Emory took over GPS duties for the rest of the trip. I kept getting/feeling slightly lost in Portland throughout my whole stay and couldn't quite get a handle of the city — even though I've been there twice before. My stress and anxiety might have had something to do with that.\n\nWe did get to the Panic sign eventually, but as it turns out, it's not much fun during daytime; you can barely see the colors.\n\nOur next stop was the nearby Pendelton store, where I got not one but two coats for a redacted amount of money. They were beautiful coats, but I ended up returning both of them after the festival, as neither of them was quite the right cut for my weird body shape. If I'm spending that much money on a cloth item, they better be a good fit.\n\nI took a break at Powell's cafe, carefully not taking a look at the books because I have a giant backlog of them already. I did finally pick up [Amy Baio's](https://twitter.com/heartshapedsky) [You Think You Know Me](https://youthinkyouknowme.cards/), though. It is, in a way, an investment in my future as I don't have too many people I can play it with right now.\n\nIt was around that time I connected with Dunja, Robert and Djordje, who arrived the day before; we met up in front of Revolution Hall just before 2 pm. I met Dunja at XOXO 2016; she was one of the few people from Eastern Europe. She introduced me to Robert in 2018, who's also from Hungary; we hung out a bunch the past year. I haven't met Djordje before; it was his first XOXO. He was Dunja's friend from Serbia.\n\nI saw on Twitter that Andrew just got in town and was looking for something to do so I invited him along.\n\nWe walked around the city, north on SE 13th St. then turned right on E Burnside St, wandering around and exploring the city for at least an hour. We ended up in Laurelhurst Park, which was pretty beautiful. After a short break, we each went our separate ways: Andrew to a museum, Dunja \u0026 co to get SIM cards and I walked to Belmont to get a late lunch.\n\nI found a place called Straight From New York Pizza, and they had decent slices, though the New York part felt like a bit of a stretch.\n\nAnticipating a high anxiety day as something triggered that the day before, I booked a massage at the Common Ground Wellness Co-op that someone recommended on the Slack. They were my next stop; I took a Lyft there. After checking in, I got undressed — the place is clothing optional — and had a great massage I really needed. Afterwards, I relaxed in their hot tub. It was a great place, and I would probably be a regular if I'd be living in Portland.\n\nOnce done, I took another Lyft back to APEX, for the now-traditional pre-XOXO Wednesday night beers. I got to have a great conversation with Andy McMillan, Jonah, Crystal, Dan and a few other people whose name escape me right now. Andy told us about his zero-proof cocktail bar, and we also learned quite a bit about Northern Ireland. For dinner, I got a rice bowl from a Vietnamese place across the street; it was pretty okay. It was a fantastic evening; it was there where I started feeling the energy XOXO gives you, and that carried me through the rest of the week. That, and all the fantastic people.\n\n![Andy and Henry](https://i.imgur.com/5qxyTGQ.jpg)\nAndy and Henry. So cute. Henry, that is (Andy if you're reading this you look great as well.)\n\nI got back to my Airbnb around 11, and it took me a while to fall asleep: I was pretty excited about the next few days. XOXO would be (officially) starting the next day.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSaturday, 28 Sep 2019\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/28/xoxo-2019-part-3/\n\nMore about...\n\n* xoxo: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/xoxo/"

Would it be possible for me to get to their place by scooters only? I had to try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ended up taking two scooters, and I got pretty far: my second scooter died about 1.5 miles from their place.

I intended to spend as much time in Portland as possible (and financially viable.) I knew from experience that even before the opening party on Thursday, there could be plenty of opportunities to hang out with people. Folks who live in Portland and others who also get in town a few days before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the advantages of flying in from Canada is you get past CBP early, on the Canadian side: once you land in the US, you go directly to picking up your suitcases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe US border is always a stressful place because of \u003cem\u003egestures at all the horror stories you can read on the internet\u003c/em\u003e but once again I cleared customs without significant issues. I got a big \u0026ldquo;X\u0026rdquo; on my returning ESTA slip because I said yes to the question \u0026ldquo;are you bringing any food, livestock, etc.\u0026rdquo; which was technically correct: I had twelve packs of Tim Tams in my suitcase. The fingerprint reader really didn\u0026rsquo;t like my right hand at the first border agent, so he redirected me to another one, where I finally got the OK I needed. In the process, I got to tell the border agent about XOXO, which meant I could check off the \u0026ldquo;tell someone about XOXO who hasn\u0026rsquo;t heard of it\u0026rdquo; box in the \u003ca href=\"https://xoxo.bingo\"\u003eXOXO bingo\u003c/a\u003e, something I worked on this year; more on that later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JHEgUOF.jpg\" alt=\"PDX\"\u003e\nHello, PDX.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter an uneventful flight, I took a Lyft to our AirBnB; we arrived almost at the same time with \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/emorydunn\"\u003eEmory\u003c/a\u003e. The place we found had a great location: just four blocks from Revolution Hall, on the corner of SE Taylor and 13th. It had mostly great reviews, and it served its purpose, but neither of us was terribly happy with it. It had an odd layout, one of the beds were way too soft — at least for me —, the washing machine was small and slow and the wifi was absolutely terrible the whole time we were there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got a late lunch with Emory at the Rogue Eastside Pub \u0026amp; Pilot Brewery; then I took a scooter (well, two) to NE at the Dillingers Barber Shop, where I had an appointment with Emily.

			"content_text": "(Previously: [Prologue](https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/25/xoxo-2019-prologue/))\n\nI arrived at Portland on Labor Day. I intended to spend as much time in Portland as possible (and financially viable.) I knew from experience that even before the opening party on Thursday, there could be plenty of opportunities to hang out with people. Folks who live in Portland and others who also get in town a few days before.\n\nOne of the advantages of flying in from Canada is you get past CBP early, on the Canadian side: once you land in the US, you go directly to picking up your suitcases.\n\nThe US border is always a stressful place because of *gestures at all the horror stories you can read on the internet* but once again I cleared customs without significant issues. I got a big \"X\" on my returning ESTA slip because I said yes to the question \"are you bringing any food, livestock, etc.\" which was technically correct: I had twelve packs of Tim Tams in my suitcase. The fingerprint reader really didn't like my right hand at the first border agent, so he redirected me to another one, where I finally got the OK I needed. In the process, I got to tell the border agent about XOXO, which meant I could check off the \"tell someone about XOXO who hasn't heard of it\" box in the [XOXO bingo](https://xoxo.bingo), something I worked on this year; more on that later.\n\n![PDX](https://i.imgur.com/JHEgUOF.jpg)\nHello, PDX.\n\nAfter an uneventful flight, I took a Lyft to our AirBnB; we arrived almost at the same time with [Emory](https://twitter.com/emorydunn). The place we found had a great location: just four blocks from Revolution Hall, on the corner of SE Taylor and 13th. It had mostly great reviews, and it served its purpose, but neither of us was terribly happy with it. It had an odd layout, one of the beds were way too soft — at least for me —, the washing machine was small and slow and the wifi was absolutely terrible the whole time we were there.\n\nWe got a late lunch with Emory at the Rogue Eastside Pub \u0026 Pilot Brewery; then I took a scooter (well, two) to NE at the Dillingers Barber Shop, where I had an appointment with Emily. Someone recommended her on Slack, and she delivered; it was one of the best beard trims I've ever had. It pains me that after moving back to Hungary almost three years ago, I still can't find a reliable barbershop. The best trims I've had in the past couple years were in San Francisco, New York and now Portland, respectively.\n\n![Selfie](https://i.imgur.com/T4I1esX.jpg)\nShe really did a great job.\n\nI got a couple of essentials in the Whole Foods across the street — you should not travel with an open bottle of Dr. Bronner's, ask me how I know — then I took a scooter downtown to Oven and Shaker, where I met up with [Sarah](https://twitter.com/fledglingnerd), Emory and [Juan](https://twitter.com/juanbuis). I was particularly excited to see Sarah again; I'll never forget [the kindness she showed on my first XOXO](https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/08/14/xoxo-2016/#tuesday-a-surprise-dinner), and she remains one of my favorite people, the best XOXO mom. She welcomed me saying how good to see me and how \"XOXO starts for me when I first see you.\" \n\nWe had a good dinner, talked a lot, caught up with each other, then Sarah took us home to our respective Airbnbs. I was anxious throughout the whole thing, but it was still great to hang out with everyone. \n\n![Us](https://i.imgur.com/gqgS8Qk.jpg)\nUs.\n\nAnd that was the end of day 1: XOXO has begun.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThursday, 26 Sep 2019\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/26/xoxo-2019-part-1/\n\nMore about...\n\n* xoxo: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/xoxo/"

Two years later I was back (I have yet to write that one up), and it was a different experience: so much has happened in those two years. And not just in the world, but also on a personal level. I became very active on the Slack, and I spent much of XOXO 2018 trying to meet all the people I only met online. That year the festival was bigger and in a different venue, and yeah, it was different, but it was still very much XOXO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Andys made clear that in 2019 they\u0026rsquo;d go back to the old size, I was somewhat conflicted. On the one hand, I understood the toll it took on them and everyone else organizing the festival, having it twice as big. There was also a fair amount of feedback from the community that the larger size didn\u0026rsquo;t work for them. I personally had a good time and got to meet a lot of people I wanted to, but that\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003emy\u003c/em\u003e experience. The venue and the location were, in many ways, indeed worse. I was also worried, in a selfish but understandable way that with the smaller size I\u0026rsquo;m going to need more luck to get picked in the lottery for a ticket. In the last year or so the XOXO Slack became an even more significant part of my online life and the thought of not going felt, frankly, unbearable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I\u0026rsquo;m writing about this, I obviously got lucky and got a ticket to XOXO this year as well; and I feel pretty confident saying that this year has been the best one I\u0026rsquo;ve attended so far. The smaller size indeed works better, and Revolution Hall is possibly the best location it can have, even with its (very minor) downsides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve written this as a travelogue because that\u0026rsquo;s the only way I know how to.

The previous few months were rough, mental health-wise — I became pretty isolated. I had a daily routine that kept me together and sane, though: I was moving between safe spaces. Wake up, get breakfast, go to my regular cafe, get work done, get home, order in something for dinner, binge on TV shows, go to sleep. Lather, rinse, repeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first half of 2019, I was on a 6-month therapy break. It was a necessary thing and in many ways, helpful; but by the end, I knew I needed to start again. After a false start, I got a new therapist late June and we clicked almost instantly. However, what was understandable but bad for my mental health is the fact that he took the entire month of August off for vacation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ended up going on a month-long trip, starting mid-August: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and finally Portland for XOXO. I thought all the travel, and going to new and exciting places — I\u0026rsquo;ve never been to Canada before — would make me feel better. Instead, the opposite happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll that structure I mentioned earlier suddenly disappeared and my mental health took a nosedive. I had a panic attack on the third day of the trip, which I mostly weathered thanks to an XOXOer who reached out — thank you, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/scruss\"\u003eStewart\u003c/a\u003e. For the rest of the trip, I was in a constant state of varying levels of anxiety, which is really not what I was going for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Toronto and Montreal (and back to Toronto for a few days), my next stop was Vancouver for a couple days with \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/emorydunn\"\u003eEmory\u003c/a\u003e, who I met at last year\u0026rsquo;s XOXO. I admit I was anxious about it: traveling with someone who you barely know can go both ways. In this case, it worked out pretty well for us, and it also improved my mental health quite a bit. Being around people, in general, helps; being around people I like and am comfortable with makes a much more significant difference, and I had a good time with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I arrived in Portland, I felt, well, not great, but better. The kind of anxiety where your emotions get numbed down and much of what you feel is the anxiety itself followed me through my time in Portland and XOXO, unfortunately.

If you do, \u003ca href=\"#beginnings-before-the-festival\"\u003eskip to the next section\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tagline of XOXO is \u0026ldquo;An experimental festival for independent artists who live and work online,\u0026rdquo; and that\u0026rsquo;s pretty accurate? It\u0026rsquo;s usually held the weekend after Labor Day, early September and runs for four days, between Thursday evening and Sunday night. It\u0026rsquo;s held at \u003ca href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/fDRB1fgzvrPwRBUJ8\"\u003eRevolution Hall in Portland, Oregon\u003c/a\u003e. It was created by two Andys, Andy Baio and Andy McMillan, who still run it (with the help others of course, as well as dozens of volunteers). It was held every year since 2012 except for 2017. It\u0026rsquo;s extremely well-organized; once you\u0026rsquo;ve been to XOXO, no other conference or festival measures up in terms of organization, attention to detail and listening to the input of attendants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchedule-wise, Thursday evening is the opening party; Friday is Social during the day, during which attendees self-organize different meetups around interests and Slack channels (more on that soon). Friday and Saturday evening hosts several topical events: Arcade (videogames), Tabletop (boardgames), Video (in 2016 it was called Film \u0026amp; Animation) and Story (podcasts and storytelling). \u003ca href=\"https://xoxofest.com/2016\"\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s the 2016 schedule\u003c/a\u003e for more information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conference itself is during Saturday and Sunday with talks from a variety of speakers. It\u0026rsquo;s wrapped up with a closing party that usually features a surprise musical guest on Sunday night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo get tickets for the festival, you have to fill out a brief questionnaire — that\u0026rsquo;s only there to weed out marketers —  and after that, you enter a lottery. If you get picked, you have 48 hours to buy your ticket (pass).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe questions are the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWho are you and what do you do?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhat are you working on right now!!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSomething you made that you\u0026rsquo;re proud of\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two kinds of passes: conference for $500 and festival only for $250. A festival pass gives you access to everything except the conference talks; however, you will see them anyway live, streamed to a bar downstairs. They are also recorded and later \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqMG_BBwxrhLG80Y3yuEu-Q\"\u003euploaded to Youtube\u003c/a\u003e. The conference pass is self-explanatory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you get a ticket, you get an invite to the private Slack, which is a massive part of the whole thing, and where a lot of people hang out before, during and after the festival. It has hundreds of channels for all kinds of topics and interests (#tv, #fitness, #star-trek, #knitting and so on) as well as local channels (#vancouver, #europe, #nyc and so on) and other miscellaneous channels, such as one for venting about random life stuff. It also hosts a sizeable amount of private channels for womxn, people of color, LGBTQIA+, non-binary people, people with disabilities (\u0026ldquo;spoonies\u0026rdquo;) and mental-health-related things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe XOXO Slack is a pretty great place; not everyone who comes to the festival joins, though. During the festival, it gets especially busy; a lot of communication and organization happens there as well as on Twitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least 85-90% of the people who go to XOXO are American; within that, the majority of people probably come from the west coast (and within that, a sizeable amount of people come from the Pacific Northwest). It\u0026rsquo;s also, by far and large, a pretty radically left-leaning place. There\u0026rsquo;s a \u003ca href=\"https://explore.xoxofest.com/guide/conduct\"\u003ecode of conduct\u003c/a\u003e which is very much enforced both offline and online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this feels a bit dry, but I think it is an important context for the rest of the series. XOXO is unlike any event I\u0026rsquo;ve ever attended, in a good way; a unique experience that everyone should try at least once if they can (and the above sounds appealing). I\u0026rsquo;ve met a lot of great people there and made friends I still have to this day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca id=\"Beginnings\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"beginnings--before-the-festival\"\u003eBeginnings — Before the Festival\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpostor syndrome runs deep within the community of XOXO, and so is the acknowledgment of it, so let\u0026rsquo;s start with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI applied for XOXO at least once before, in 2014, because a friend of mine also did. And I remember that even back then, I was staring at the survey questions (see \u003ca href=\"https://writetogether.space/posts/ktamas/what-is-xoxo-anyway\"\u003eyesterday\u0026rsquo;s post\u003c/a\u003e), and feeling something like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;No, I don\u0026rsquo;t belong here. XOXO is a place for makers, artists, creators — I am not one of them. Or, maybe I am, but I don\u0026rsquo;t do anything visible. I\u0026rsquo;m just a guy who finds all these people interesting and would love to meet them, but \u003cem\u003eI\u003c/em\u003e am not interesting. I don\u0026rsquo;t do anything that would qualify as me being worthwhile of XOXO.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I filled it out anyway, sent it in — and the random generator did not pick me. It did pick my friend who went and had a blast, though; he said it was full of people who \u0026ldquo;you want to hang out with all the time\u0026rdquo; so I took note that this is a cool thing and I should try it sometime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout two years later, the application form popped up again, in \u003ca href=\"https://waxy.org/\"\u003eAndy Baio\u0026rsquo;s linkblog\u003c/a\u003e. Okay, whatever, let\u0026rsquo;s apply, maybe I slip through the cracks and get lucky with the lottery this time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feelings from years before haven\u0026rsquo;t changed much. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a sexy side-project up on Github to show. I had a very unsexy job: a freelance consultant, a jack-of-all-trades generalist working in IT. That\u0026rsquo;s still my job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrote something about being a community organizer. Which is true — I like making and organizing communities. I am not half bad at it, although I am am very aware of my severe shortcomings as well. I sent in the form and went back to whatever I was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was traveling a lot at the time, and it must have been about a month after I applied when I woke up in my Airbnb in Riga, Latvia and saw an email: I got one of the late-last-minute festival passes. I had 48 hours to buy it and a couple of weeks to refund it if I change my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was surprised. I knew that the \u0026lsquo;regular\u0026rsquo; tickets were sent out already, and I did not get any email, so I resigned myself to my fate — oh well, no XOXO for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now this email.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ticket was refundable for like three weeks after buying it, so I figured I\u0026rsquo;ll buy it in any case. I still had time to change my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started checking the flights to Portland, feeling a not-so-vague itch for visiting NYC before that, but eventually convincing myself that no, I\u0026rsquo;ll just go for Portland, visit XOXO, then go back home. I just committed myself to a bunch of other things anyway; so I got a return flight from Gothenburg to Portland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was going to XOXO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter getting my ticket, I joined the Slack for the festival, wrote a long intro into #intro channel, and started getting to know people. I wrote about it in the \u003ca href=\"https://writetogether.space/posts/ktamas/what-is-xoxo-anyway\"\u003efirst part of this series\u003c/a\u003e; over the last three years, it\u0026rsquo;s become a massive part of my social life on the internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter finishing up my trip to Eastern Europe, I went to Germany for a week for a work project. Once that was wrapped up, I was back home in Sweden, telling my therapist how miserable I was. My friend Jane wanted me to fix her computer; Joe wanted me to decide if I will sell my phone to him or not and so on. I also took on a bunch of other responsibilities to keep myself busy, because I suddenly found myself with a lot of time on my hands. I told him all that and the fact that I was tired of it all, and I just wanted to leave everything and go to New York. He pointed it out that this can be simple: if I don\u0026rsquo;t want to fix Jane\u0026rsquo;s computer, or sell Joe my phone, I can say no; if I want to go to New York, I can go. I had time, and I had the money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was Friday morning. By Friday evening, I rented out my apartment, had my ticket for my flight on Sunday, booked two Airbnbs and was ready to go. I was going to the USA for a month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose three weeks in NYC were amazing, exhausting and draining. I love that city, and it overwhelms me, and I am tempted to write a few more paragraphs about it, but that\u0026rsquo;s not \u003cem\u003ethis\u003c/em\u003e story. (You can check out that story \u003ca href=\"https://writetogether.space/users/ktamas\"\u003eon WriteTogether\u003c/a\u003e, I have about 19 posts about it)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy digital XOXO experience started on the Slack, but the real-life one started earlier than the festival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was in New York, someone organized a pre-conference meetup at the Lavender Lake bar. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know anyone there in person (I did join the Slack just weeks before after I got my ticket), and frankly it was a bit intimidating at first: all these cool people, many of them working at interesting tech companies. Someone just left Spotify; someone else just started working at Meetup. Another person was working for Tumblr! I was starstruck, in many ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I quickly became comfortable and had great conversations. I got to know Skyler, Allison, PBJ, Darrell, Kate, Jason, Scott, Leigh and others I don\u0026rsquo;t remember right now. I remember Darrell showing off his \u003ca href=\"https://www.containerstore.com/s/office/tech-accessories/gostrap-phone-strap/12d?productId=10035812\"\u003egoStrap\u003c/a\u003e on his phone, a thing I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen before; later in the evening I enthusiastically told the story of \u003ca href=\"https://writetogether.space/posts/ktamas/the-as-of-yet-unwritten-oral-history-of-turulcsirip-an-early-twitter-client-and-community\"\u003eTurulcsirip\u003c/a\u003e to Scott and Leigh. We\u0026rsquo;ve made plans to hang at XOXO again, and many of us did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was extremely welcoming, and there was a strong sense of community that I came to appreciate at XOXO. In many ways, the meetup was already XOXO and everything that\u0026rsquo;s good about it. Three years later \u003ca href=\"https://writetogether.space/posts/ktamas/day-7-park-slope-and-beyond\"\u003eI\u0026rsquo;d be the one to organize an XOXO meetup in Lavender Lake\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few days before that the \u003ca href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80057691\"\u003eXOXO movie\u003c/a\u003e was released by Netflix, which had nothing to do with the festival (this was quite a bit of a headache for the Andys). I watched it alone, but then I watched it again a few days later with everyone on Slack, and it was a lot of fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter my NYC trip and a quick detour to Minnesota, I arrived in Portland on a Tuesday morning, not realizing that the festival starts that day, at least unofficially.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca id=\"Tuesday\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"tuesday--a-surprise-dinner\"\u003eTuesday — A Surprise Dinner\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArriving in Portland, I was filled with the excitement that comes from visiting a new place, a novelty that always wears off, but I try to enjoy it as much as I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy Airbnb was pretty great, even though it had two cats. I\u0026rsquo;m not good with pets, but the owner said the cats are not allowed in the guest spaces and it worked out. The cats left me alone, and the first time in my life I was pretty much not bothered them being around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e(\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not good with pets\u0026rdquo; is kind of an understatement: by far and large, I don\u0026rsquo;t like pets. I have my reasons. I feel like a terrible person just writing this, but there, I said it. Hi, I am Tamas, and even though everyone I meet seems to like a) cats b) dogs c) both, I don\u0026rsquo;t.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Airbnb was at a great location (around SE 35th Pl and Hawthorne), so I just started walking around in the neighborhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter an hour or two, I came to understand that yes, Portlandia is in many ways a documentary, but that\u0026rsquo;s not at all a problem. Hawthorne, the neighboorhood is really cool, full of cafes, vintage stores and great food places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a very forgettable lunch at \u003ca href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/rice-junkies-portland-6\"\u003eRice Junkies\u003c/a\u003e then got dessert at \u003ca href=\"https://www.bluestardonuts.com\"\u003eBlue Star Donuts\u003c/a\u003e next door. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really like their stuff; I prefer the yeasty kind of donuts, which is why my favorite in Portland is \u003ca href=\"https://www.voodoodoughnut.com/\"\u003eVoodoo Doughnuts\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the early afternoon, I headed Downtown to \u003ca href=\"https://www.powells.com/\"\u003ePowell\u0026rsquo;s\u003c/a\u003e, the legendary bookstore. It\u0026rsquo;s a great place though somewhat overwhelming; there is a reason that around that time I banned myself from bookstores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the afternoon, I was kind of bored and aimless, sitting at a Starbucks, so I asked on Slack if anyone wants to do a pre-pre-XOXO hangout. I only got a few replies. Andy McMillan said he might be up for something in the evening, though he said he\u0026rsquo;d be working; and \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/fledglingnerd\"\u003eSarah\u003c/a\u003e, someone I didn\u0026rsquo;t know also mentioned that she might be available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the evening, I asked again, and not much response came — until a few minutes later when I got a private message from Sarah, who invited me for dinner to her house, which turned out to be about 5 minutes from my Airbnb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis caught me completely off-guard. A stranger inviting me to dinner? To her house? The day I arrived?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s stop here for a second to talk about extremely stereotypical cultural differences. Let me stress that: these are unscientific, personal experiences and observances, fused with bad stereotypes, and I know the reality is far more nuanced, but this is the only way I can tell this story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am Hungarian: we often don\u0026rsquo;t like each other very much, especially when we live abroad: we avoid each other, or form cliques. I personally try to avoid Hungarians outside of Hungary as much as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHungary has never felt like home for me, and I was extremely glad when I was able to move to Sweden. At the time, I was living there for more than 3 years, and it was the first place I felt home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter moving to Sweden, I quickly became aware that I do not fit in society well, nor I have a desire to do so. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the same aspirations of someone Swedish. I didn\u0026rsquo;t like the language (though that changed later) and had almost no motivation to learn it since almost everyone spoke good English and my work did not require me to speak Swedish. I found myself an international church pretty quickly, which helped me to have a social life for the first few years, and in the last year or so there I started having more friends outside of the church. Expats living here, students on Erasmus or doing their masters, etc. I had friends, and I was grateful for them, but the fact remained: I lived in a society where I felt like I could not connect with the majority of the people and that\u0026rsquo;s kind of isolating and lonely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, I am at least half-American in my heart: I\u0026rsquo;ve always been able to get along well with Americans, and I fit into the society a lot better; I can connect to people. And after more than 3 years of Sweden, being in a country where I could connect with people was \u003cem\u003eamazing\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I have not expected a dinner invitation from a stranger. Nevertheless, I have gladly accepted and was welcomed. As Sarah was cooking dinner — veggies, pasta, shrimps — we had a great conversation. She told me about the Thorns, the local women\u0026rsquo;s soccer team and the huge fanbase behind it, and even though I don\u0026rsquo;t care much about soccer (except every two years when there is a World Cup or a Eurocup), she made it sound really interesting, even inviting me to a game the next day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think one of the mental breakthroughs I had came shortly after that. I was still nervous and told Sarah that this might be the time to be extremely rude. Without missing a beat, she said \u0026ldquo;Oh, good. I like rude.\u0026rdquo; I told her I\u0026rsquo;m an extremely picky eater and besides the pasta she just put into that big pot, I do not like any of the veggies nor the shrimp there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was not judged, nor mocked, but instead offered to join her daughter having pasta with tomato sauce and cheese and I am forever grateful for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater that night, Sarah and I went to APEX, a pub, to hang out Andy McMillan, who was still very busy working on XOXO, but nevertheless had some time to chat with us. I felt like being in the presence of a celebrity. Just how amazing is a festival when the very first time you\u0026rsquo;re in town, you get a dinner invitation and later hang out with one of the organizers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca id=\"Wednesday\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"wednesday--the-day-before\"\u003eWednesday — The Day Before\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWednesday morning, we watched the Apple keynote together on the Slack in #apple — so weird being in the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; timezone for once — and commented through it, which was heaps of fun. After that, I picked up my rental camera for XOXO, a Fuji X-Pro 2 with a 56mm f/1.2 lens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the evening we had beers at APEX again, this time, with a lot more people. It was fun, and I had some great conversations, including one with someone called Mary, though that\u0026rsquo;s all I can remember (if you\u0026rsquo;re Mary and are reading this somehow: hi!). I was somewhat underdressed and freezing, though, and a bit under myself (likely slightly exhausted from the overwhelming Tuesday) so I ended up leaving early.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca id=\"Thursday\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"thursday-mefi-meetup-opening-party\"\u003eThursday — MeFi Meetup, Opening Party\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThursday morning, about a dozen of us met up at \u003ca href=\"https://goodwith.us/\"\u003eGood Coffee\u003c/a\u003e.

We got pins — I think we could pick two — which were retro-themed, but all had \u0026ldquo;XOXO\u0026rdquo; on them. I also managed to score the secret pin from Andy McMillan, which was the NeXT logo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/n7sNqDM.jpg\" alt=\"pins\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked a couple blocks to a restaurant, only to find it closed, so we went back to Revolution Hall and had sandwiches at \u003ca href=\"https://meatcheesebread.com/\"\u003eMeat Cheese Bread\u003c/a\u003e, right next to the venue.

It was a byproduct of all the travel weeks before, how I traveled, and how I feel like I failed to set limits when I should have. I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a lot about myself on this trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXOXO 2016 marked an end of an era for me. About a week after the festival, the thought that I want to leave Sweden and move to Hungary finally made its way from my subconscious into my conscious thoughts. I made the move at the end of the year; it was hard but ultimately worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe festival took place at an interesting time in American politics; just months before the 2016 elections, back when Donald Trump was definitely A Thing but no-one expected him to win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI credit the festival, the friends I made there and my subsequent presence on the Slack (and all the new people I followed on Twitter) for making me move politically further left and opening my eyes to certain privileges I have. There are a lot of things I still wrestle with; the biggest thing would be the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s an extremely US-centric place. I\u0026rsquo;m not American, and I don\u0026rsquo;t live there (as much as I want to be), so I see and experience a lot of things through a different lens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got an idea or two for pet projects after the festival that I never followed through. Still, attending gives you this unique boost in creativity that I value. Someone at XOXO said that when inspiration hits, you have to grab it and run with it. That is something I should do more often, but come to think of it — it\u0026rsquo;s something I already do more often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve made a quite a few friends there, and then more on the Slack afterwards. In 2018, I came back with a mental list of people I wanted to meet, having only talked online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve said it in the beginning, but it needs to be said again: XOXO sets an incredibly high bar to conferences and festivals with their attention to every single detail and their willingness to listen to community feedback. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve been to an XOXO, you\u0026rsquo;re spoiled forever, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be hard-pressed to find something else that measures up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you again, Andy, Andy, Rachel and all the volunteers. You\u0026rsquo;ve created something extraordinary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfooter\u003e\n    \u003ca title=\"Permanent link to “XOXO 2016 recap”\" href=\"https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/08/14/xoxo-2016/\"\u003eXOXO 2016 recap\u003c/a\u003e\n    by KTamas for \u003ca href=\"https://blog.ktamas.com/\"\u003eKTamas\u0026#39; Blog\u003c/a\u003e\n    Tagged\n        \u003cdiv class=\"tags\"\u003e\n            \u003ci class=\"fas fa-tags\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n            \u003ca href='/tags/xoxo/'\u003exoxo\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/footer\u003e",

If you do, [skip to the next section][Beginnings].\n\n---\n\nThe tagline of XOXO is \"An experimental festival for independent artists who live and work online,\" and that's pretty accurate? It's usually held the weekend after Labor Day, early September and runs for four days, between Thursday evening and Sunday night. It's held at [Revolution Hall in Portland, Oregon](https://goo.gl/maps/fDRB1fgzvrPwRBUJ8). It was created by two Andys, Andy Baio and Andy McMillan, who still run it (with the help others of course, as well as dozens of volunteers). It was held every year since 2012 except for 2017. It's extremely well-organized; once you've been to XOXO, no other conference or festival measures up in terms of organization, attention to detail and listening to the input of attendants.\n\n---\n\nSchedule-wise, Thursday evening is the opening party; Friday is Social during the day, during which attendees self-organize different meetups around interests and Slack channels (more on that soon). Friday and Saturday evening hosts several topical events: Arcade (videogames), Tabletop (boardgames), Video (in 2016 it was called Film \u0026 Animation) and Story (podcasts and storytelling). [Here's the 2016 schedule](https://xoxofest.com/2016) for more information.\n\nThe conference itself is during Saturday and Sunday with talks from a variety of speakers. It's wrapped up with a closing party that usually features a surprise musical guest on Sunday night.\n\n---\n\nTo get tickets for the festival, you have to fill out a brief questionnaire — that's only there to weed out marketers —  and after that, you enter a lottery. If you get picked, you have 48 hours to buy your ticket (pass). \n\nThe questions are the following:\n- Who are you and what do you do?\n- What are you working on right now!!\n- Something you made that you're proud of\n\nThere are two kinds of passes: conference for $500 and festival only for $250. A festival pass gives you access to everything except the conference talks; however, you will see them anyway live, streamed to a bar downstairs. They are also recorded and later [uploaded to Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqMG_BBwxrhLG80Y3yuEu-Q). The conference pass is self-explanatory.\n\n---\n\nIf you get a ticket, you get an invite to the private Slack, which is a massive part of the whole thing, and where a lot of people hang out before, during and after the festival. It has hundreds of channels for all kinds of topics and interests (#tv, #fitness, #star-trek, #knitting and so on) as well as local channels (#vancouver, #europe, #nyc and so on) and other miscellaneous channels, such as one for venting about random life stuff. It also hosts a sizeable amount of private channels for womxn, people of color, LGBTQIA+, non-binary people, people with disabilities (\"spoonies\") and mental-health-related things.\n\nThe XOXO Slack is a pretty great place; not everyone who comes to the festival joins, though. During the festival, it gets especially busy; a lot of communication and organization happens there as well as on Twitter.\n\n---\n\nAt least 85-90% of the people who go to XOXO are American; within that, the majority of people probably come from the west coast (and within that, a sizeable amount of people come from the Pacific Northwest). It's also, by far and large, a pretty radically left-leaning place. There's a [code of conduct](https://explore.xoxofest.com/guide/conduct) which is very much enforced both offline and online.\n\n---\n\nAll of this feels a bit dry, but I think it is an important context for the rest of the series. XOXO is unlike any event I've ever attended, in a good way; a unique experience that everyone should try at least once if they can (and the above sounds appealing). I've met a lot of great people there and made friends I still have to this day.\n\n\u003ca id=\"Beginnings\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n## Beginnings — Before the Festival\n\nImpostor syndrome runs deep within the community of XOXO, and so is the acknowledgment of it, so let's start with that.\n\nI applied for XOXO at least once before, in 2014, because a friend of mine also did. And I remember that even back then, I was staring at the survey questions (see [yesterday's post](https://writetogether.space/posts/ktamas/what-is-xoxo-anyway)), and feeling something like this: \n\n\"No, I don't belong here. XOXO is a place for makers, artists, creators — I am not one of them. Or, maybe I am, but I don't do anything visible. I'm just a guy who finds all these people interesting and would love to meet them, but *I* am not interesting. I don't do anything that would qualify as me being worthwhile of XOXO.\"\n\nBut I filled it out anyway, sent it in — and the random generator did not pick me. It did pick my friend who went and had a blast, though; he said it was full of people who \"you want to hang out with all the time\" so I took note that this is a cool thing and I should try it sometime.\n\nAbout two years later, the application form popped up again, in [Andy Baio's linkblog](https://waxy.org/). Okay, whatever, let's apply, maybe I slip through the cracks and get lucky with the lottery this time?\n\nMy feelings from years before haven't changed much. I didn't have a sexy side-project up on Github to show. I had a very unsexy job: a freelance consultant, a jack-of-all-trades generalist working in IT. That's still my job.\n\nI wrote something about being a community organizer. Which is true — I like making and organizing communities. I am not half bad at it, although I am am very aware of my severe shortcomings as well. I sent in the form and went back to whatever I was doing. \n\nI was traveling a lot at the time, and it must have been about a month after I applied when I woke up in my Airbnb in Riga, Latvia and saw an email: I got one of the late-last-minute festival passes. I had 48 hours to buy it and a couple of weeks to refund it if I change my mind. \n\nI was surprised. I knew that the 'regular' tickets were sent out already, and I did not get any email, so I resigned myself to my fate — oh well, no XOXO for me.\n\nAnd now this email. \n\nHuh.\n\nThe ticket was refundable for like three weeks after buying it, so I figured I'll buy it in any case. I still had time to change my mind.\n\nI started checking the flights to Portland, feeling a not-so-vague itch for visiting NYC before that, but eventually convincing myself that no, I'll just go for Portland, visit XOXO, then go back home. I just committed myself to a bunch of other things anyway; so I got a return flight from Gothenburg to Portland.\n\nBut I was going to XOXO.\n\nAfter getting my ticket, I joined the Slack for the festival, wrote a long intro into #intro channel, and started getting to know people. I wrote about it in the [first part of this series](https://writetogether.space/posts/ktamas/what-is-xoxo-anyway); over the last three years, it's become a massive part of my social life on the internet.\n\nAfter finishing up my trip to Eastern Europe, I went to Germany for a week for a work project. Once that was wrapped up, I was back home in Sweden, telling my therapist how miserable I was. My friend Jane wanted me to fix her computer; Joe wanted me to decide if I will sell my phone to him or not and so on. I also took on a bunch of other responsibilities to keep myself busy, because I suddenly found myself with a lot of time on my hands. I told him all that and the fact that I was tired of it all, and I just wanted to leave everything and go to New York. He pointed it out that this can be simple: if I don't want to fix Jane's computer, or sell Joe my phone, I can say no; if I want to go to New York, I can go. I had time, and I had the money.\n\nThat was Friday morning. By Friday evening, I rented out my apartment, had my ticket for my flight on Sunday, booked two Airbnbs and was ready to go. I was going to the USA for a month.\n\nThose three weeks in NYC were amazing, exhausting and draining. I love that city, and it overwhelms me, and I am tempted to write a few more paragraphs about it, but that's not *this* story. (You can check out that story [on WriteTogether](https://writetogether.space/users/ktamas), I have about 19 posts about it)\n\n---\n\nMy digital XOXO experience started on the Slack, but the real-life one started earlier than the festival.\n\nWhen I was in New York, someone organized a pre-conference meetup at the Lavender Lake bar. I didn't know anyone there in person (I did join the Slack just weeks before after I got my ticket), and frankly it was a bit intimidating at first: all these cool people, many of them working at interesting tech companies. Someone just left Spotify; someone else just started working at Meetup. Another person was working for Tumblr! I was starstruck, in many ways.\n\nBut I quickly became comfortable and had great conversations. I got to know Skyler, Allison, PBJ, Darrell, Kate, Jason, Scott, Leigh and others I don't remember right now. I remember Darrell showing off his [goStrap](https://www.containerstore.com/s/office/tech-accessories/gostrap-phone-strap/12d?productId=10035812) on his phone, a thing I've never seen before; later in the evening I enthusiastically told the story of [Turulcsirip](https://writetogether.space/posts/ktamas/the-as-of-yet-unwritten-oral-history-of-turulcsirip-an-early-twitter-client-and-community) to Scott and Leigh. We've made plans to hang at XOXO again, and many of us did.\n\nEveryone was extremely welcoming, and there was a strong sense of community that I came to appreciate at XOXO. In many ways, the meetup was already XOXO and everything that's good about it. Three years later [I'd be the one to organize an XOXO meetup in Lavender Lake](https://writetogether.space/posts/ktamas/day-7-park-slope-and-beyond).\n\n---\n\nA few days before that the [XOXO movie](https://www.netflix.com/title/80057691) was released by Netflix, which had nothing to do with the festival (this was quite a bit of a headache for the Andys). I watched it alone, but then I watched it again a few days later with everyone on Slack, and it was a lot of fun.\n\n---\n\nAfter my NYC trip and a quick detour to Minnesota, I arrived in Portland on a Tuesday morning, not realizing that the festival starts that day, at least unofficially.\n\n\u003ca id=\"Tuesday\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n## Tuesday — A Surprise Dinner\n\nArriving in Portland, I was filled with the excitement that comes from visiting a new place, a novelty that always wears off, but I try to enjoy it as much as I can. \n\nMy Airbnb was pretty great, even though it had two cats. I'm not good with pets, but the owner said the cats are not allowed in the guest spaces and it worked out. The cats left me alone, and the first time in my life I was pretty much not bothered them being around.\n\n*(\"I'm not good with pets\" is kind of an understatement: by far and large, I don't like pets. I have my reasons. I feel like a terrible person just writing this, but there, I said it. Hi, I am Tamas, and even though everyone I meet seems to like a) cats b) dogs c) both, I don't.)*\n\nThe Airbnb was at a great location (around SE 35th Pl and Hawthorne), so I just started walking around in the neighborhood.\n\nAfter an hour or two, I came to understand that yes, Portlandia is in many ways a documentary, but that's not at all a problem. Hawthorne, the neighboorhood is really cool, full of cafes, vintage stores and great food places. \n\nI had a very forgettable lunch at [Rice Junkies](https://www.yelp.com/biz/rice-junkies-portland-6) then got dessert at [Blue Star Donuts](https://www.bluestardonuts.com) next door. I didn't really like their stuff; I prefer the yeasty kind of donuts, which is why my favorite in Portland is [Voodoo Doughnuts](https://www.voodoodoughnut.com/).\n\nIn the early afternoon, I headed Downtown to [Powell's](https://www.powells.com/), the legendary bookstore. It's a great place though somewhat overwhelming; there is a reason that around that time I banned myself from bookstores. \n\nBy the afternoon, I was kind of bored and aimless, sitting at a Starbucks, so I asked on Slack if anyone wants to do a pre-pre-XOXO hangout. I only got a few replies. Andy McMillan said he might be up for something in the evening, though he said he'd be working; and [Sarah](https://twitter.com/fledglingnerd), someone I didn't know also mentioned that she might be available. \n\nIn the evening, I asked again, and not much response came — until a few minutes later when I got a private message from Sarah, who invited me for dinner to her house, which turned out to be about 5 minutes from my Airbnb.\n\nThis caught me completely off-guard. A stranger inviting me to dinner? To her house? The day I arrived?\n\n---\n\nLet's stop here for a second to talk about extremely stereotypical cultural differences. Let me stress that: these are unscientific, personal experiences and observances, fused with bad stereotypes, and I know the reality is far more nuanced, but this is the only way I can tell this story.\n\nI am Hungarian: we often don't like each other very much, especially when we live abroad: we avoid each other, or form cliques. I personally try to avoid Hungarians outside of Hungary as much as possible.\n\nHungary has never felt like home for me, and I was extremely glad when I was able to move to Sweden. At the time, I was living there for more than 3 years, and it was the first place I felt home.\n\nBut.\n\nAfter moving to Sweden, I quickly became aware that I do not fit in society well, nor I have a desire to do so. I didn't have the same aspirations of someone Swedish. I didn't like the language (though that changed later) and had almost no motivation to learn it since almost everyone spoke good English and my work did not require me to speak Swedish. I found myself an international church pretty quickly, which helped me to have a social life for the first few years, and in the last year or so there I started having more friends outside of the church. Expats living here, students on Erasmus or doing their masters, etc. I had friends, and I was grateful for them, but the fact remained: I lived in a society where I felt like I could not connect with the majority of the people and that's kind of isolating and lonely.\n\nOn the other hand, I am at least half-American in my heart: I've always been able to get along well with Americans, and I fit into the society a lot better; I can connect to people. And after more than 3 years of Sweden, being in a country where I could connect with people was *amazing*.\n\nStill, I have not expected a dinner invitation from a stranger. Nevertheless, I have gladly accepted and was welcomed. As Sarah was cooking dinner — veggies, pasta, shrimps — we had a great conversation. She told me about the Thorns, the local women's soccer team and the huge fanbase behind it, and even though I don't care much about soccer (except every two years when there is a World Cup or a Eurocup), she made it sound really interesting, even inviting me to a game the next day.\n\nI think one of the mental breakthroughs I had came shortly after that. I was still nervous and told Sarah that this might be the time to be extremely rude. Without missing a beat, she said \"Oh, good. I like rude.\" I told her I'm an extremely picky eater and besides the pasta she just put into that big pot, I do not like any of the veggies nor the shrimp there. \n\nI was not judged, nor mocked, but instead offered to join her daughter having pasta with tomato sauce and cheese and I am forever grateful for that.\n\nLater that night, Sarah and I went to APEX, a pub, to hang out Andy McMillan, who was still very busy working on XOXO, but nevertheless had some time to chat with us. I felt like being in the presence of a celebrity. Just how amazing is a festival when the very first time you're in town, you get a dinner invitation and later hang out with one of the organizers?\n\n\u003ca id=\"Wednesday\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n## Wednesday — The Day Before\n\nWednesday morning, we watched the Apple keynote together on the Slack in #apple — so weird being in the \"right\" timezone for once — and commented through it, which was heaps of fun. After that, I picked up my rental camera for XOXO, a Fuji X-Pro 2 with a 56mm f/1.2 lens.\n\nIn the evening we had beers at APEX again, this time, with a lot more people. It was fun, and I had some great conversations, including one with someone called Mary, though that's all I can remember (if you're Mary and are reading this somehow: hi!). I was somewhat underdressed and freezing, though, and a bit under myself (likely slightly exhausted from the overwhelming Tuesday) so I ended up leaving early.\n\n\u003ca id=\"Thursday\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n## Thursday — MeFi Meetup, Opening Party\n\nThursday morning, about a dozen of us met up at [Good Coffee](https://goodwith.us/). I got to know a couple of people — [Patrick](https://twitter.com/patrickbjohnson)! John! Others! — as well as meeting up with someone I've met at the XOXO meetup in New York (hi, [Darrell](https://twitter.com/drldCsta), [Ryan](https://twitter.com/ryanluikens) and [Ben](https://facesofxoxo2016.tumblr.com/post/150269612573/ben-johnson-gamedesignerben)). Around 12, we walked to Revolution Hall to pick up our badges and the obligatory swag.\n\n![Patrick](https://66.media.tumblr.com/140c0866675241ca0258c7702fa5c838/tumblr_odd4gdwDEH1vffpu1o1_1280.jpg)\nPatrick\n\n![Darrel](https://66.media.tumblr.com/56fd15d0aa18e3c07fc99b2a429e8ac5/tumblr_odcq2mB9PO1vffpu1o1_1280.jpg)\nDarrell\n\nThe badges were amazing. In some ways, I was happy that I only had a festival-only pass,  as it was pink and looked a lot cooler than the yellow conference one. We got pins — I think we could pick two — which were retro-themed, but all had \"XOXO\" on them. I also managed to score the secret pin from Andy McMillan, which was the NeXT logo.\n\n![pins](https://i.imgur.com/n7sNqDM.jpg)\n\nWe walked a couple blocks to a restaurant, only to find it closed, so we went back to Revolution Hall and had sandwiches at [Meat Cheese Bread](https://meatcheesebread.com/), right next to the venue. That's when I met with [Dunja](https://twitter.com/DunjaLazic) and a couple of other people as well. She was the only person I got to know there who was also from Eastern Europe. \n\n![Dunja](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8641ddeecbbc9a80ff09843fc4bfe42d/tumblr_odcqc8QHLd1vffpu1o1_1280.jpg)\nDunja\n\nEarly afternoon I got to know [Owen](https://twitter.com/ow), [Sarah](https://twitter.com/sehsarah) and [Christine](https://twitter.com/chrstnerode); we took Biketown rides to Downtown to a cafe called Barista, where we hung out for a while.\n\nAfterwards, I went back to the other side of the river for the Metafilter meetup at Rogue Eastside Pub.\n\nI've been a member of the site for years, but this was my first meetup, and I loved it. I had a bunch of great conversations and got to know [Josh](https://twitter.com/joshmillard) (aka Cortex) and Angela (aka Secretariat), his wife, among other people. I also took a few good portraits along the way and handed them out; people enjoyed them a lot, Josh [tweeted about it](https://twitter.com/joshmillard/status/774040934400995328) and [even made a painting out of it](http://art.joshmillard.com/2016/04/26/selfportrait-after-a-polaroid-photo-by-tamas/).\n\n![Josh](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ed894d428cd9372a077947dc2b3c6e5/tumblr_odd0ooCcus1vffpu1o1_1280.jpg)\nJosh\n\nSee, I had a magic trick. It's a pricy one, and it's only magic once, but it's pretty damn good: I take portraits of people and after a minute hand it to them. It's printed on a polaroid, or to be more precise, a Fuji Instax Mini film. The camera I rented combined with the Fuji Instax SP-2 mobile printer I had is what makes all this happen.\n\nThe meetup wrapped up in time for the opening party, which marked the official start of XOXO. It was probably a few minutes into the party where it really hit me: There are over a thousand interesting people here, and most of the time, I can just walk up and talk with them! With anyone! It's amazing!\n\nI had a lot of conversations with a lot of great people that night. A few highlights:\n\n* Two minutes of awkward fanboying with [Jessie Char](https://twitter.com/jessiechar), with something like \"Hi! I loved the, uh, the Mule Podcast you did and I especially loved the makeup tutorial you did on periscope once and I am a huge fan and can I take your picture and here it is printed hope you like it\". She was delighted that someone remembered that one periscope.\n* Meeting James and a few other people from Backerkit\n* The food truck Cereal from a Van, which is exactly its namesake: you could have a bowl of cereal (with unlimited refills!) for like $3. They had a huge selection of cereals (and milk) and made recommendations if asked for. The whole thing should have been ridiculous but somehow wasn't; maybe because it was so earnest. I had cereal every single day of XOXO from that van. On the opening night, someone started a pay-it-forward chain that literally lasted the entire party.\n* I met [Emily](https://twitter.com/duien), and she was great.\n* I also had the chance the first time in my life to chat with someone with adult ADHD, thanks to the Slack. I asked not long before the festival if there were others with adult ADHD, and we could maybe chat? Two people said yes; I had lunch with the other guy on Sunday.\n\nIt was an amazing day, and I had no idea how much more fun I'd have in the next few.\n\n\u003ca id=\"Friday\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n## Friday — Social, Arcade, Story\n\nFriday started for me with morning yoga on top of Revolution Hall, which I really needed. For breakfast, I got donuts at [Pip's](http://www.pipsmobile.com/) then got in line for [Fried Eggs I'm in Love](http://www.friedegglove.com/), who sold the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. While waiting, I met up with [Skyler](https://twitter.com/hello_skyler) again, who I got to know at the XOXO meetup and got to chat with [Tiffany](https://twitter.com/tiffysniffs), who had a really cool \"Keeping it Corny\" pin that I immediately bought from her (you can buy it [here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/463022590/keep-it-corny-125-hard-enamel-pin)). \n\n![Skyler](https://66.media.tumblr.com/96c3ba2bd81b0913025c4d72ed7f78bc/tumblr_odcsocipAh1vffpu1o1_1280.jpg)\nSkyler\n\n![Tiffany](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a5a4f3d0fec0bb31a11fda7df5c6b00/tumblr_odcsu9Vs821vffpu1o1_1280.jpg)\nTiffany\n\n![Pin](https://i.imgur.com/c1EKuDI.jpg)\nMy face looks terrible but look at that pin.\n\nAfter listening to the Andys' opening remarks, the Social part of the festival started. The first one I went to was the #photography meetup, a photowalk organized by [Sasha](https://twitter.com/microwavenby). We walked around Portland and took loads of pictures, including photos of people taking photos, which is pretty much a photowalk tradition. \n\n![Ryan](https://66.media.tumblr.com/81319956d1d5fe70ad3499a6a554c404/tumblr_odcr91eQxI1vffpu1o1_1280.jpg)\n[Ryan](https://twitter.com/ryanleggett)\n\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/FJn5lBf.jpg)\n\n![2](https://i.imgur.com/vmcmuEo.jpg)\n\nI chatted with [Katie](https://twitter.com/katieelambert) and [Sarita](https://twitter.com/sarita__alami) from Mailchimp; one of them were/are the one responsible for all the podcasts sponsorships, which sounded like the coolest job ever (still does). I took their portraits, and it ended up on the company's Snapchat.\n\n![Sarita](https://66.media.tumblr.com/951c21b68e6888068bf2298b1393eec1/tumblr_odcrdsZGBT1vffpu1o1_1280.jpg)\nSarita\n\n![Katie](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f6699554bd5131741163ebb06c2a2697/tumblr_odcrhpVdV91vffpu1o1_1280.jpg)\nKatie\n\n![Snapchat](https://i.imgur.com/68RjjMK.jpg)\nThe pictures on Snapchat\n\nTowards the end, I ended up chatting with [Clint](https://twitter.com/madebyclint) and went to [Voodoo Donuts](http://voodoodoughnut.com), which was almost a religious experience: I love their donuts so much.\n\n![Clint](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0db639a0636132d5f671c40d9cceac16/tumblr_odcxzrZC2D1vffpu1o1_1280.jpg)\nClint\n\n![Donuts](https://i.imgur.com/SN4GWUG.jpg)\nDonuts\n\nDone with my snack, I made my way to the Panic offices where they had an open house. They have a pretty cool space, and there were loads of people hanging out. Highlights include seeing a working [NeXT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT) computer and getting my picture taking with the walkie-talkie from [Firewatch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/383870/Firewatch/), one of my favorite videogames.\n\n![Firewatch](https://i.imgur.com/MZFesxV.jpg)\n\nI kind of crashed around 3 pm, so I went back to my Airbnb to rest.\n\nMy evening was split between Story and Arcade. At Arcade, I played with [Headmaster](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/headmaster-ps4/), a game for the Playstation VR (which, back then was still in beta). It was the first VR kit I've found comfortable (especially with glasses on), and the game is loads of fun: you have to head balls to various targets while trying to escape from the Football Improvement Center run by a [GLaDOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLaDOS)-like evil AI.\n\nAt Story, I listened to — and participated in — [Rose Eveleth's](https://twitter.com/roseveleth) interactive [Flash Forward](https://www.flashforwardpod.com/), a podcast about the future. It was a collective choose-your-own-adventure, where we could vote on things at various points of the story. It was a fun experience. \n\n[Gaby Dunn's and Allison Raskin's](https://www.gabyandallison.com) [Just Between Us](https://www.youtube.com/user/justbetweenusshow/videos) was also fun, a dating advice show this time live on stage. It was really funny.\n\nThe evening closed with [Derek Powazek's](https://twitter.com/fraying) [Fray](http://fray.com/index-old.shtml), a storytelling event, which was pretty much my favorite thing at XOXO 2016. It started at 11, and there must have been at best two dozen people in the auditorium in the front rows. At the time, I listened to a lot of [The Moth](https://themoth.org/podcast), a storytelling podcast, and always dreamed of attending one live, and this was pretty damn close to that. I was tired to my bones, but somehow the stories kept me awake and alert — pretty much all of them were great, though I only remember one by now. \n\n![Derek](https://i.imgur.com/04ZJ07d.jpg)\nDerek\n\nI kind of wish I had signed up in retrospect — though if my memory serves me right when they announced the signups I didn't really get the whole thing. After I got back to my Airbnb, I recited myself an impromptu story, as I would have told it on stage.\n\nThen I passed out.\n\n\u003ca id=\"Saturday\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n## Saturday — Conference, Day 1 + Film\n\nSaturday morning marked the first day of the conference. I got breakfast once again from Fried Eggs I'm In Love, then went to the Shark Pizza Donut meetup. That was a codename we came up within the #singles Slack channel, so people would not assume we're there to hit on. \n\nAfter the meetup, I went to Martha's, a bar within Revolution Hall where talks were livestreamed to for people with festival passes.\n\n![Jenn](https://i.imgur.com/5PGxd5a.jpg)\nI ran into [Jenn Schiffer](https://twitter.com/jennschiffer), not knowing she is presenting the next day, and really admired her laptop sticker game.\n\nThe overarching theme of this XOXO that year was indie makers, money and vulnerability. Highlights from the morning: [Gaby Dunn](https://www.twitter.com/gabydunn) [talked about](https://xoxofest.com/2016/projects/gaby-dunn) the perils of signing contracts without reading, predatory contracts, trying to make it as a freelancer and being [Bad with Money](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bad-with-money-with-gaby-dunn/id1144712710), a podcast she started just before the festival and since then [turned into a book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FQVGG7P/) as well. [Talia Jane](https://www.twitter.com/itsa_talia) [talked about](https://xoxofest.com/2016/projects/talia-jane) going viral with [her letter to Yelp's CEO](https://medium.com/@taliajane/an-open-letter-to-my-ceo-fb73df021e7a), a story that surprisingly has a happy ending.\n\nI had lunch with [Dylan](https://twitter.com/dylanw) from Slack, who also had adult ADHD. We ended up at a gay bar called Crush near the venue, where I got the coolest sticker for my laptop. I still kick myself for not getting more than one.\n\n![sticker](https://i.imgur.com/1OcuwYz.jpg)\n\nHighlights from the afternoon: [Neil Cicierega](https://twitter.com/neilcic) [talked about](https://xoxofest.com/2016/projects/neil-cicierega) growing up with computers from an early age, going viral and making a ton of things, including mind-bending Smash Mouth-centric mashups (my favorite one is [Mouth Moods](http://www.neilcic.com/mouthmoods/) and [The Ultimate Showdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WgT9gy4zQA) which some of you might know. [Starlee Kine](https://twitter.com/StarleeKine) is the creator of the [Mystery Show](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/mystery-show), one of the best podcasts ever made, that got unjustly canceled, but she started working on a new episode which you can [support on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/starleekine). She [talked about](https://xoxofest.com/2016/projects/starlee-kine) the creative process and how her show got made. \n\n[John Roderick](https://twitter.com/johnroderick) [talked about](https://xoxofest.com/2016/projects/john-roderick) the myth of no effort, being a musician, a podcaster, running for office, mental health issues and important differences between Seattle and Portland. [Lucy Bellwood](https://twitter.com/LuBellWoo) who's really into boats [got really honest](https://xoxofest.com/2016/projects/lucy-bellwood) about publishing books, and being successful online while not necessarily making a lot of money. She is the creator of [100 demon dialogues](https://lucybellwood.com/100-demon-dialogues/), which you should definitely check out; I even got a demon plushie.\n\nAt one point, I managed to spot another person who in my head was a bona fide internet celebrity, one of my internet heroes: Dan Hon. I read his twitter and took his portrait while being starstruck and extremely awkward. Spoilers: two years later we had a great chat at XOXO 2018. If you go to enough XOXOs, you slowly get over the whole celebrity thing.\n\nThe evening program was Tabletop and Film; I went by Tabletop at one point but didn't really find anything interesting, so I spent most of my time at Film. I really enjoyed [Every Frame A Painting](https://www.youtube.com/user/everyframeapainting) premiering a new episode, [Auralnuts](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1xCZ4ODNM2OJuKoBrghDA) being funny and [Homestar Runner's](https://homestarrunner.com/) reunion/live show (anyone remembers Strong Bad?)\n\nThat was Saturday. I was getting exhausted, but there was still the final day to come.\n\n\u003ca id=\"Sunday\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n## Sunday — Conference, Day 2\n\nIn the morning, I went for a run with limited success, then had pancakes for breakfast. After that, I went to Revolution Hall for the final day of the conference. \n\nBy the last day of the festival, I was exhausted, mostly emotionally. In the previous days, I [took a lot of pictures](http://facesofxoxo2016.tumblr.com) and printed them for people, but I just didn't have it in me on closing day. \n\nI uploaded pictures at Martha's while watching the Conference talks. Some highlights: [Simone Giertz](https://twitter.com/SimoneGiertz), Queen of Shitty robots [talked about](https://xoxofest.com/2016/projects/simone-giertz) the importance of building useless things. [Jenn Schiffer](https://twitter.com/jennschiffer) [talked about](https://xoxofest.com/2016/projects/jenn-schiffer) writing satire on the internet, being on Twitter as a self-described Lady Code Troll and reminded us to never stop talking about Peter Thiel wanting to replace his blood with younger people's blood. [Sarah Jeong](https://twitter.com/sarahjeong) [talked about](https://xoxofest.com/2016/projects/sarah-jeong) pivoting from lawyer to being a writer, argued for adblockers as someone who works in media, and how she got into reporting on important tech lawsuits. \n\nThe closing talk by the Andys was really emotional and raw; very much on-brand for the conference, but I mean it sincerely. I had (and have) a lot of empathy towards these guys who spend an immense amount of time putting this festival together.\n\nThe closing party for the evening was at the [XOXO Outpost](https://outpostpdx.com/), a coworking space for indie makers that unfortunately closed down since. I had a vegetarian burrito bowl from a food truck and ice cream from Salt and Straw.\n\n![car](https://i.imgur.com/BeVIDA3.jpg)\nThis was a cool car close to the Outpost.\n\nThe surprise musical guest was [Dan Deacon](https://www.dandeacon.com/), and people seemed to be really into him, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. I ended up hanging out with a bunch of people outside the venue. It was around then I ran into one of my other internet heroes, [Samuel Clay](https://twitter.com/samuelclay), who created the RSS reader [NewsBlur](http://newsblur.com); I've been using that ever since Google Reader got shut down. He was in a sudden need of a place to sleep at, and I managed to convince my Airbnb host to let him crash there. \n\nAs a thank you gift, he gave me one of the early prototypes of [Turn Touch](https://shop.turntouch.com/), a wooden smart remote he was working on at the time (and since released).\n\nI left the party somewhat early, feeling completely wiped out. But there would be one more XOXO thing the next day.\n\n\u003ca id=\"Monday\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n## Monday — Post-Festival Pancakes\n\nOn Monday, I went by a Coinstar machine to convert all the loose change I accumulated over almost a month in the US; I think I got something around $13 in total. I returned my rental camera and then went to [Slappy Cakes](https://www.slappycakes.com/portland) for an informal post-XOXO pancake lunch with about two dozen people, including the Andys. It was fun, and I got a hug from Andy McMillan, which meant a lot to me.\n\nAnd then, XOXO, the festival was over. Until who knows when; the Andys later announced they were taking at least the following year off, and then, who knows. Even before that, they would never commit to another year immediately, but this time we knew there wouldn't be one in 2017.\n\n*(Of course, now we know that XOXO returned in 2018, after which they explicitly promised it would come back in 2019. But back then, there was a sense of uncertainty.)*\n\n\u003ca id=\"Reflections\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n## Reflections\n\nI feel fortunate that I got to go to XOXO in 2016. It definitely altered the course of my life, and the community became a huge part of my online — and sometimes offline — social life. I know I'm not alone in that.\n\nI truly enjoyed my time there, even though I felt this strong emotional numbness/exhaustion, but that's (mostly) not XOXO's fault. It was a byproduct of all the travel weeks before, how I traveled, and how I feel like I failed to set limits when I should have. I've learned a lot about myself on this trip.\n\nXOXO 2016 marked an end of an era for me. About a week after the festival, the thought that I want to leave Sweden and move to Hungary finally made its way from my subconscious into my conscious thoughts. I made the move at the end of the year; it was hard but ultimately worth it. \n\nThe festival took place at an interesting time in American politics; just months before the 2016 elections, back when Donald Trump was definitely A Thing but no-one expected him to win.\n\nI credit the festival, the friends I made there and my subsequent presence on the Slack (and all the new people I followed on Twitter) for making me move politically further left and opening my eyes to certain privileges I have. There are a lot of things I still wrestle with; the biggest thing would be the fact that it's an extremely US-centric place. I'm not American, and I don't live there (as much as I want to be), so I see and experience a lot of things through a different lens.\n\nI got an idea or two for pet projects after the festival that I never followed through. Still, attending gives you this unique boost in creativity that I value. Someone at XOXO said that when inspiration hits, you have to grab it and run with it. That is something I should do more often, but come to think of it — it's something I already do more often.\n\nI've made a quite a few friends there, and then more on the Slack afterwards. In 2018, I came back with a mental list of people I wanted to meet, having only talked online.\n\nI've said it in the beginning, but it needs to be said again: XOXO sets an incredibly high bar to conferences and festivals with their attention to every single detail and their willingness to listen to community feedback. Once you've been to an XOXO, you're spoiled forever, and you'll be hard-pressed to find something else that measures up.\n\nThank you again, Andy, Andy, Rachel and all the volunteers. You've created something extraordinary.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWednesday, 14 Aug 2019\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/08/14/xoxo-2016/\n\nMore about...\n\n* xoxo: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/xoxo/"

It\u0026rsquo;s best watched not knowing anything about it but here are the first five minutes: Nadia leaves her birthday party, and on the way home gets hit by a taxi, and dies. The next moment Nadia is back where the episode started, alive and well, on her own birthday party. It\u0026rsquo;s up on Netflix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Star_Trek_Discovery_title_card.jpg\"\u003eStar Trek: Discovery (Season 2)\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0026rsquo;ve only seen three episodes of the new season so far but all of them have been great and I very much like this new take on Star Trek. The fact that it\u0026rsquo;s a prequel to The Original Series bothers me, though, because they could have had a lot more creative freedom and do less retconning if it would be set in another universe. It\u0026rsquo;s also up on Netflix or CBS All Access if you\u0026rsquo;re in the US.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna_(TV_series)\"\u003eHanna (pilot)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e: This is based on the excellent \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993842/\"\u003emovie of the same name\u003c/a\u003e.

It's best watched not knowing anything about it but here are the first five minutes: Nadia leaves her birthday party, and on the way home gets hit by a taxi, and dies. The next moment Nadia is back where the episode started, alive and well, on her own birthday party. It's up on Netflix.\n\n**[Star Trek: Discovery (Season 2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Star_Trek_Discovery_title_card.jpg):** I've only seen three episodes of the new season so far but all of them have been great and I very much like this new take on Star Trek. The fact that it's a prequel to The Original Series bothers me, though, because they could have had a lot more creative freedom and do less retconning if it would be set in another universe. It's also up on Netflix or CBS All Access if you're in the US.\n\n**[Hanna (pilot)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna_(TV_series))**: This is based on the excellent [movie of the same name](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993842/).

			"content_html": "\u003ch2 id=\"facts\"\u003eFacts\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s start with a few facts. I\u0026rsquo;m fat. I\u0026rsquo;m 174 (5'7\u0026rdquo;) and I weight about 125 kilos (275 pounds). I\u0026rsquo;ve had high blood pressure for the last 15 years or so, though the causes of that are complex. My cholesterol is officially considered high as of a few months ago, and if I don\u0026rsquo;t do something about it, I\u0026rsquo;ll have to start taking meds for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge part of it is likely genetics; men on my father\u0026rsquo;s side are historically overweight. But my terrible eating schedule (or the lack of thereof) and compulsive snacking does not help either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won\u0026rsquo;t go into my diet too much, because that\u0026rsquo;s material for another post; in any case, it\u0026rsquo;s a fact that exercise is something I definitely need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"traumas\"\u003eTraumas\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a messy relationship with working out and exercise in general. I was a chubby kid who was bullied growing up and I sucked at gym class. Having shitty teachers didn\u0026rsquo;t help either. So what I quickly learned is to just give up. Had to run laps for a few minutes, and I\u0026rsquo;m out of breath after 20 seconds? Just walk the rest of the way. The teacher will yell at you, classmates will make fun of you, but \u003cem\u003ewhatever\u003c/em\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s the least bad option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn high school, I got lucky and got transferred to the special gym class, for kids with mild disabilities, motor issues and such. It was easier: only two classes a week, and one of them was swimming. Which I am not great at, but not the worst either. Even there, I mostly just gave up on things quickly, but there was a lot less bullying and judging going around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"changes\"\u003eChanges\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I was finished with school, I more or less stopped thinking of or worrying about exercise and didn\u0026rsquo;t do much for almost ten years. There were times when I\u0026rsquo;d go swimming for a couple times before I would get bored with it (I still do). There were short periods when I was biking instead of taking the public transport, but they never lasted. When I broke my leg in 2014, I did do a decent amount of physical therapy, but I half-assed even that somewhat. To this day, my right leg, the one that was broken is still a bit weaker. I would go to the gym irregularly after that, mostly doing 20-30 minutes on the elliptical machine. I kind of wanted to exercise, but a huge part of me was fighting against it mentally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen one day, about three years ago, while being stuck in a nasty loop of self-pity, a friend of mine miraculously got me to (somewhat) snap out of it by getting me to sign up for a military boot camp-style workout program. We made a deal: I would go 10 times, and I can stop after that if I wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ended up going only six times, and I hated most of it, except for one part: running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"running\"\u003eRunning\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the reasons I never considered running before was that it felt like the most boring thing ever; about as dull as swimming, if not more. That, and all the bad experiences in gym class growing up. But I had this strange urge to do it anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I started it was still very much winter, so I went to a sports store, got a bunch of warm running clothes, downloaded Runkeeper on my phone and then I just\u0026hellip; ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly realized that the only way I can do this is running intervals; that is, running a while, then walking a while, then running a while and so on. Runkeeper has a nifty feature where you can set up custom intervals; most of the time I tried to stick to 90 seconds of running and 60 seconds of walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never had much of a running schedule. I would have phases; I would go for a run three times in one week, then skip the next two weeks. As I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned it earlier, it was a constant fight with myself. Part of me felt this urge to go for a run almost every day, but another part of me was actively fighting against it. I know this is a common experience; it\u0026rsquo;s one that didn\u0026rsquo;t really change over the years, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMostly eschewing \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; races, I was racing myself, trying to improve my pace. My dream was running a 5K in 30 minutes, which is a 6:00 pace average (the best I ever did was about 4K with 6:46 on a treadmill). I ran both outside and inside; each has pros and cons. Being outside gives you variety and makes things less boring; however, on a treadmill I can set a pace and push myself more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did find one race that I kept going back to called \u003ca href=\"https://www.morfitrun.com/szigetrun\"\u003eSziget Run\u003c/a\u003e a monthly timed 5K at Margaret\u0026rsquo;s Island in Budapest, a popular running place. There is a bit of a community around it, and the organizers are great. It became this fixed thing in my life: once a month I would get up early, and do a 5K with a bunch of people. Most of the time I would finish dead last, but everyone was always a good sport about it, cheering me on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing on my bucket list was doing a complete lap around Central Park, which I was fortunate enough to do when I went for a trip to NY in late 2016. It was literally one of the first things I did there. My pace was terrible, and I felt like I was dying towards the end but I did it, and I\u0026rsquo;m still proud of it. The next day I would run an even longer distance around Williamsburg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe longest run I did was last summer: it was a 12K race I signed up for. I first signed up for the 6K, then changed my mind in the last minute, thinking 6K is not much of a challenge, but I never did 12K, so why not? I finished last and my body was not happy with me afterwards, but I\u0026rsquo;m glad I did it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI very seldom got what people call \u0026ldquo;runner\u0026rsquo;s high\u0026rdquo;, but for a long time, I did feel much better after a good run. It was a challenge to get started, hell, it was a challenge to keep going but in the end, I would be rewarded with those sweet, sweet endorphins. Until I wasn\u0026rsquo;t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround 2018 I was going through a time when I was pretty depressed, and running slowly started being less and less enjoyable. One could make the argument that exercise is not about enjoying it, but I digress; you need to get at least some form of satisfaction from it to keep going. And what kept happening was that I would go for a run, and come away feeling just as bad or even worse after it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast fall, when I was at XOXO 2018 I co-organized two morning runs that were quite popular. I\u0026rsquo;m happy that I did that; at the same time, it was the last time I would go for a run, at least for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"this-story-is-not-over\"\u003eThis story is not over\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was going through some old diary entries late last year and I noticed a pattern: every 3 months or so, I would make myself a note: get a personal trainer. For years. So last month, after not doing any form of exercise since September or so, I did just that, with the goal of working out thrice a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve only been 6 times so far, because I had to skip almost 2 weeks as I got sick, but so far, so good. We mostly do weights and some cardio, though yesterday we did a session with mostly \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training\"\u003eHIIT\u003c/a\u003e.

			"content_text": "## Facts\nLet's start with a few facts. I'm fat. I'm 174 (5'7\") and I weight about 125 kilos (275 pounds). I've had high blood pressure for the last 15 years or so, though the causes of that are complex. My cholesterol is officially considered high as of a few months ago, and if I don't do something about it, I'll have to start taking meds for it.\n\nA huge part of it is likely genetics; men on my father's side are historically overweight. But my terrible eating schedule (or the lack of thereof) and compulsive snacking does not help either.\n\nI won't go into my diet too much, because that's material for another post; in any case, it's a fact that exercise is something I definitely need.\n\n## Traumas\nI have a messy relationship with working out and exercise in general. I was a chubby kid who was bullied growing up and I sucked at gym class. Having shitty teachers didn't help either. So what I quickly learned is to just give up. Had to run laps for a few minutes, and I'm out of breath after 20 seconds? Just walk the rest of the way. The teacher will yell at you, classmates will make fun of you, but *whatever*. It's the least bad option.\n\nIn high school, I got lucky and got transferred to the special gym class, for kids with mild disabilities, motor issues and such. It was easier: only two classes a week, and one of them was swimming. Which I am not great at, but not the worst either. Even there, I mostly just gave up on things quickly, but there was a lot less bullying and judging going around.\n\n## Changes\nAfter I was finished with school, I more or less stopped thinking of or worrying about exercise and didn't do much for almost ten years. There were times when I'd go swimming for a couple times before I would get bored with it (I still do). There were short periods when I was biking instead of taking the public transport, but they never lasted. When I broke my leg in 2014, I did do a decent amount of physical therapy, but I half-assed even that somewhat. To this day, my right leg, the one that was broken is still a bit weaker. I would go to the gym irregularly after that, mostly doing 20-30 minutes on the elliptical machine. I kind of wanted to exercise, but a huge part of me was fighting against it mentally.\n\nThen one day, about three years ago, while being stuck in a nasty loop of self-pity, a friend of mine miraculously got me to (somewhat) snap out of it by getting me to sign up for a military boot camp-style workout program. We made a deal: I would go 10 times, and I can stop after that if I wanted to.\n\nI ended up going only six times, and I hated most of it, except for one part: running.\n\n## Running\nOne of the reasons I never considered running before was that it felt like the most boring thing ever; about as dull as swimming, if not more. That, and all the bad experiences in gym class growing up. But I had this strange urge to do it anyway.\n\nWhen I started it was still very much winter, so I went to a sports store, got a bunch of warm running clothes, downloaded Runkeeper on my phone and then I just... ran.\n\nI quickly realized that the only way I can do this is running intervals; that is, running a while, then walking a while, then running a while and so on. Runkeeper has a nifty feature where you can set up custom intervals; most of the time I tried to stick to 90 seconds of running and 60 seconds of walking.\n\nI never had much of a running schedule. I would have phases; I would go for a run three times in one week, then skip the next two weeks. As I've mentioned it earlier, it was a constant fight with myself. Part of me felt this urge to go for a run almost every day, but another part of me was actively fighting against it. I know this is a common experience; it's one that didn't really change over the years, though.\n\n---\n\nMostly eschewing \"real\" races, I was racing myself, trying to improve my pace. My dream was running a 5K in 30 minutes, which is a 6:00 pace average (the best I ever did was about 4K with 6:46 on a treadmill). I ran both outside and inside; each has pros and cons. Being outside gives you variety and makes things less boring; however, on a treadmill I can set a pace and push myself more.\n\nI did find one race that I kept going back to called [Sziget Run](https://www.morfitrun.com/szigetrun) a monthly timed 5K at Margaret's Island in Budapest, a popular running place. There is a bit of a community around it, and the organizers are great. It became this fixed thing in my life: once a month I would get up early, and do a 5K with a bunch of people. Most of the time I would finish dead last, but everyone was always a good sport about it, cheering me on.\n\nOne thing on my bucket list was doing a complete lap around Central Park, which I was fortunate enough to do when I went for a trip to NY in late 2016. It was literally one of the first things I did there. My pace was terrible, and I felt like I was dying towards the end but I did it, and I'm still proud of it. The next day I would run an even longer distance around Williamsburg.\n\nThe longest run I did was last summer: it was a 12K race I signed up for. I first signed up for the 6K, then changed my mind in the last minute, thinking 6K is not much of a challenge, but I never did 12K, so why not? I finished last and my body was not happy with me afterwards, but I'm glad I did it.\n\n---\n\nI very seldom got what people call \"runner's high\", but for a long time, I did feel much better after a good run. It was a challenge to get started, hell, it was a challenge to keep going but in the end, I would be rewarded with those sweet, sweet endorphins. Until I wasn't.\n\nAround 2018 I was going through a time when I was pretty depressed, and running slowly started being less and less enjoyable. One could make the argument that exercise is not about enjoying it, but I digress; you need to get at least some form of satisfaction from it to keep going. And what kept happening was that I would go for a run, and come away feeling just as bad or even worse after it.\n\nLast fall, when I was at XOXO 2018 I co-organized two morning runs that were quite popular. I'm happy that I did that; at the same time, it was the last time I would go for a run, at least for a while.\n\n## This story is not over\nI was going through some old diary entries late last year and I noticed a pattern: every 3 months or so, I would make myself a note: get a personal trainer. For years. So last month, after not doing any form of exercise since September or so, I did just that, with the goal of working out thrice a week.\n\nI've only been 6 times so far, because I had to skip almost 2 weeks as I got sick, but so far, so good. We mostly do weights and some cardio, though yesterday we did a session with mostly [HIIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training). I have mixed feelings about it, we'll see how it works out in the long run.\n\nMy personal trainer and I talked about going running once the weather gets better, so who knows, I might pick it up again. For now, my goal is to do a solid hour of workout and hope that I feel at least somewhat better after. I'm not there yet, but I don't hate it either, so the jury's still out.\n\nIn any case, I'll keep going.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThursday, 14 Feb 2019\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/02/14/on-excercise/\n\nMore about...\n\n* running:  https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/running/\n* exercise: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/exercise/"

The first phone with a decent camera arrived to me in 2013 in the form of an iPhone 4S, and I was a convert. I took a lot of photos in the next few years with it and the other iPhones I eventually upgraded to (a 5S, then a 6+ then back to the 5S). People were still my focus, but I also took a lot of random pictures for social media. The 5S was surprisingly capable of capturing a good sunset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started playing with film photography around 2010, borrowing my dad\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Contax_137_MD\"\u003eContax SLR\u003c/a\u003e collecting dust.

I got the 6D and eventually two lenses for it: the 40mm f/2.8 pancake and the 85mm f/1.8, the latter being my favorite lens to this day: it\u0026rsquo;s razor-sharp and takes the best portraits. I got a flash for it as well, and it sort of became my \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo; camera. I got into party photography and became really good at dancing with a heavy DSLR in one hand.

			"content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI signed the new contract for my apartment a couple days ago. There has been a change: my youngest sister is moving in with her boyfriend, so one of my friends is taking her place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ll miss my sister. We get along well and enjoy each other\u0026rsquo;s company. In practice, she\u0026rsquo;s been gone for more, than six months now: spending the majority of her time at her boyfriend\u0026rsquo;s place and coming home for only a couple days a month. I\u0026rsquo;m happy for her, but I still miss her. So I\u0026rsquo;ve been living alone for a while now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve lived alone on and off during the last decade or so. I\u0026rsquo;ve been privileged enough to be able to pick my flatmates. I have an aversion of living with strangers, so I always picked people I know, friends or at least acquaintances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, just because you know the person moving in with you, does not mean you know how it\u0026rsquo;s like to actually live with them. I got lucky with that as well so far; all my flatmates were great, and we got along well. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping for the same with my new one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could have looked for another place to live when I got the news from my sister, but this is one of the best apartments I\u0026rsquo;ve had so far. It\u0026rsquo;s the right size, it has a big kitchen with a gas stove and a lot of working area, there\u0026rsquo;s a decent amount of natural light and most importantly, it has AC — something that\u0026rsquo;s rare in Hungary — for the humid 35°C (95°F) summers we have in Budapest. There are two big, separate rooms, perfect for two people. It would be nice to have an additional living room, but still, I really can\u0026rsquo;t complain.

			"content_text": "I signed the new contract for my apartment a couple days ago. There has been a change: my youngest sister is moving in with her boyfriend, so one of my friends is taking her place.\n\nI'll miss my sister. We get along well and enjoy each other's company. In practice, she's been gone for more, than six months now: spending the majority of her time at her boyfriend's place and coming home for only a couple days a month. I'm happy for her, but I still miss her. So I've been living alone for a while now.\n\nI've lived alone on and off during the last decade or so. I've been privileged enough to be able to pick my flatmates. I have an aversion of living with strangers, so I always picked people I know, friends or at least acquaintances.\n\nOf course, just because you know the person moving in with you, does not mean you know how it's like to actually live with them. I got lucky with that as well so far; all my flatmates were great, and we got along well. I'm hoping for the same with my new one.\n\nI could have looked for another place to live when I got the news from my sister, but this is one of the best apartments I've had so far. It's the right size, it has a big kitchen with a gas stove and a lot of working area, there's a decent amount of natural light and most importantly, it has AC — something that's rare in Hungary — for the humid 35°C (95°F) summers we have in Budapest. There are two big, separate rooms, perfect for two people. It would be nice to have an additional living room, but still, I really can't complain. And it's affordable, especially for the area it's in: the rent is 440€, with the total being around 490-520€ per month, the latter including utilities and Internet. All of that gets divided between two people, of course.\n\nThe location is excellent, well-connected, with major metro and tram lines closeby. It's not quite in the heart of Budapest, but everything is still pretty close.\n\n*(I feel like I'm writing an ad for the apartment here, but no, you can't have it.)*\n\n---\n\nIt's gonna take me a while to adjust to living with someone again, but I'm hoping for the best.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTuesday, 12 Feb 2019\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/02/12/on-living-alone-living-with-flatmates-and-having-the-best-apartment/\n\nMore about...\n\n* musings:  https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/musings/\n* thoughts: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/thoughts/"

			"content_text": "I'm a freelancer; I don't have an office. I can't work from home; the silence is deafening, I need the background noise, and I need to be among people. The place I work from every day is a café about 25 minutes from my home; it's called [Flow](https://www.facebook.com/flowcoffeeandbistro/). I am a person of habit: I wake up, I get dressed, I go to Flow and start working.\n\nFlow is one of the many, many specialty cafés in Budapest. Don't ask me about their coffee: I mostly eschew caffeine — [my ADHD meds](https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/02/02/re-take-your-pills-my-story-of-adhd/) mostly replace caffeine — so my regular drink is an iced decaf latte with oat milk. It's one of the most pointless drinks ever, but I like it.\n\nSo I don't go to Flow for their coffee, but for everything else. It's big; ceilings about 5 meters high and plenty of space, unlike most cafés. They have fresh pastries delivered every morning; if I get there early enough, I can nab one of my favorite chocolate rolls. And I kinda know some of the people running the place. They used to have great wifi as well, until the people responsible for it installed a network filter on it, blocking random sites and making work impossible. Thank God for unlimited 4G and tethering. They're vegan, and I'm a carnivore, but they do have delicious tapioca pudding desserts. That, and plenty of power outlets.\n\nBefore Flow, I had another café as my base; before that place, another. I tried coworking spaces, and I was even part of one for about 6 months before the community around it started to dwindle.\n\n---\n\nOn weekends or where I'm traveling, I go to a Starbucks. They usually have decent wifi, and their decaf is the same everywhere. They're ubiquitous; you can find many of them in most major western cities these days (except for Sweden; there, I'll go to an Espresso House instead).\n\n---\n\nWorking from cafés is in many ways is not ideal, but it's the thing that works for me. What *would be* ideal is a proper office, with coworkers — but I can't give up freelancing for so many reasons. And it's not like I'm alone here; I get to hang out with other friends who work remotely.\n\nSo cafés it is.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMonday, 4 Feb 2019\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/02/04/flow-on-remote-work-and-cafes/\n\nMore about...\n\n* flow:         https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/flow/\n* remotework:   https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/remotework/\n* digitalnomad: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/digitalnomad/"

From kindergarten, I had poor social skills: I would get bullied a lot, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of friends either. The first 8 years I attended a grand total of 5 different schools, which didn\u0026rsquo;t help either, neither did the fact that I was fired from the penultimate one for said lack of social skills and my old school did not take me back for the same reason. I\u0026rsquo;ve spent most of the last 3 years homeschooled, and by homeschooled I mean being home mostly by myself, learning the material on my own and having tests at the end of each semester to get grades. I was a smart kid as well, and while I\u0026rsquo;d like to think I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too obnoxious about it, I\u0026rsquo;m sure that didn\u0026rsquo;t help, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e(the homeschooling thing is a whole \u0026lsquo;nother story which I\u0026rsquo;ll not go into it here, but let me just say, it was, in some ways, genuinely helpful for me)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents were not great at handling all this.

I was raised in a fairly strict fundamentalist Christian household, so they\u0026rsquo;d mostly respond with various forms of punishment, and yes that included corporal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have to take a small detour here: besides my ADHD, I\u0026rsquo;ve had undiagnosed anxiety issues and OCD as well. When most people hear OCD, they think of the shit you see in the movies: people closing the door precisely six times, obsessively cleaning things, etc. While there are cases that are like that, a lot, I repeat, a lot of people live with OCD where it mostly happens in their head. For me, that manifested in a lot of crazy irrational fears going around in my head on loop 24/7 and a sense of helplessness of me not being able to counter them. My OCD wouldn\u0026rsquo;t get diagnosed until well into adulthood; I might write more on it later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"getting-diagnosed\"\u003eGetting diagnosed\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis detour is crucial because ultimately my OCD was what lead to a huge meltdown I had when I was 12. I was \u003cem\u003eout of it\u003c/em\u003e for days, full of crazy fears (another story for another day) and my parents did not handle that too well either. After a few days, they took me to an inpatient psychiatric clinic, which was a pretty traumatic experience (once again, another story for another day) but they did finally diagnose me with ADHD and gave me medication for it (Ritalin IR 10mg, once or twice a day, can\u0026rsquo;t quite remember). After this, I became homeschooled for the rest of elementary school (see above). My parents say I improved with medication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back to attending school in grade 9 for four years of high school. The first year was hell; I still had no social skills and still got bullied a lot. But something started to change in the second year, and by the end of that I had a group of friends, reasonable social skills,  wasn\u0026rsquo;t bullied too much anymore, and the last two years of high school is something I genuinely enjoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround the age of 16 or so, to the recommendation of my psychiatrist, my parents stopped giving me medication. My parents claim they switched to placebo and didn\u0026rsquo;t notice a difference; to be fair, neither did I at the time. They said I \u0026ldquo;grew out of it,\u0026rdquo; which was a popular notion at the time. You also have to keep in mind that ADHD medication, research and pretty much everything usually lags at least 10-15 years behind the US in Hungary (and to a certain degree, in Europe). We know better, nowadays, that a lot of ADHD kids don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;grow out of it\u0026rdquo; and struggle through adulthood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI worked as a journalist through high school and started freelancing with a translation agency as well, who hired me full-time after my graduation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings went mostly well for the first few years; everything was new, and novelty is a huge motivational factor for ADHD. Working in the same office together with people is helpful too, not to mention deadlines. They did let me be a generalist and work at my own pace when client work was not involved. This was both a blessing and a curse; I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel any unnecessary pressure, but in hindsight, I procrastinated a lot and beat myself up for it (I still do). I don\u0026rsquo;t subscribe to the cult and fetishization of productivity, but that\u0026rsquo;s a fact. A bit of nudge from someone goes a long way. I was suffering in a lot of different ways as well; I\u0026rsquo;ll get back to these things later in this article.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"getting-rediagnosed\"\u003eGetting rediagnosed\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was 21 when somehow, I genuinely don\u0026rsquo;t remember how, I stumbled upon a book that\u0026rsquo;d change my life: \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003719FSW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8\u0026amp;btkr=1\"\u003eYou Mean I\u0026rsquo;m Not Lazy, Stupid or Crazy?!: The Classic Self-Help Book for Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder\u003c/a\u003e. I read it, and I immediately knew, I still had ADHD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went through a long and arduous process of being rediagnosed, not unlike the one \u003ca href=\"https://writetogether.space/posts/owen/take-your-pills\"\u003eOwen describes\u003c/a\u003e, so I\u0026rsquo;ll skip the description of the process. For me it took weeks, and it kinda sucked, but in the end, I got my diagnosis and started medication once again. Ritalin IR, 10mg, twice a day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s take a break here and talk more about ADHD itself and how it feels for me. Strap in; this might take a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"talking-about-adhd-and-what-is-it-anyway\"\u003eTalking about ADHD and what is it anyway?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me start by saying that it\u0026rsquo;s hard to talk to people about your ADHD and its symptoms. \u003cem\u003eA lot\u003c/em\u003e of people will brush it or its symptoms off with things like \u0026ldquo;oh yeah I procrastinate too,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;yeah sometimes I forget where my keys are\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;yeah I can\u0026rsquo;t motivate myself to do boring things.\u0026rdquo; I could go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eADHD is not about whether you procrastinate, forget your keys, or have a hard time doing boring things, among other things. To get a diagnosis, you have to meet a certain set of criteria, and they have to do with a lot of different things and \u003cem\u003emore importantly, the severity of them\u003c/em\u003e. That is what most people don\u0026rsquo;t realize when they say things like the ones I listed above. You can find \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders\"\u003eDSM-V\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rsquo;s fairly good criteria listed \u003ca href=\"https://www.addrc.org/dsm-5-criteria-for-adhd/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eI will explicitly not go into the \u0026ldquo;is ADHD being overdiagnosed/are our kids being overmedicated\u0026rdquo; debate — that\u0026rsquo;d be an entire post in itself.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eADHD is the utter, extremely frustrating inability to focus on something that you consciously wants to. Your brain, through a variety of factors, decides what to focus on by itself and you have very limited say in that. This is one of the reasons Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder is a terrible name: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a deficit of attention, I just can\u0026rsquo;t focus it like \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotypical\"\u003eneurotypical\u003c/a\u003e people do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiologically, people with ADHD have the \u003ca href=\"https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-brain-prefrontal-cortex-attention-emotions/\"\u003eprefrontal cortex of their brain all messed up\u003c/a\u003e. That\u0026rsquo;s the part regulating thoughts, feelings, impulses. The linked article gives a really good overview on that as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other big biological factor is \u003ca href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/adhd-dopamine\"\u003enot having enough dopamine\u003c/a\u003e in your brain, which is where most stimulant medication help. \u003ca href=\"https://www.additudemag.com/stimulant-medications-for-adhd/\"\u003eThis ADDitude magazine article\u003c/a\u003e has a good overview on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA large part of ADHD is what they call Executive Dysfunction (ED). \u003ca href=\"https://www.additudemag.com/7-executive-function-deficits-linked-to-adhd/\"\u003eThis article has a good overview of it\u003c/a\u003e; the parts that \u003cem\u003eI find affecting me\u003c/em\u003e are issues with inhibition, working memory, emotional self-regulation, self-motivation and to a certain degree, planning. Let me extend on these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-adhd-feels-like-and-looks-like-to-me\"\u003eHow ADHD feels like and looks like to me\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIssues with emotional self-regulation manifest in me with a sense of being constantly bombarded by and feeling helpless against overwhelming emotions, especially the negative ones. I am particularly extremely sensitive to rejection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy long-term memory is pretty great, however my short-term (working) memory is absolutely terrible. With my attention frequently being as bad as a butterfly — insert \u0026ldquo;look, squirrel!\u0026rdquo; joke here — it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to get lost in my thoughts and forget things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are things that help with this. Medication helps. Writing todo lists help. Breaking things down into subtasks help. Sticking to said todo-lists is eternally work-in-progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Oh I don\u0026rsquo;t need to write this down, I will remember it\u0026rdquo; is the biggest lie I keep telling myself, and I still fall for it. If I know I need something done and/or remembered, I\u0026rsquo;ll 1. add it to my calendar 2. add it to my weekly todo list 3. make a reminder for it 4. if it\u0026rsquo;s more important, make 2 or 3 reminders for it, because sometimes I just ignore the first reminder and forget about the whole thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProblems around inhibition and impulsivity are abound. A lot of times, particularly with people, I either just close myself up completely or end up at the other extreme: blurt things out without thinking or start oversharing (people who know me and are reading this are heavily nodding at this point). For me, this applies to anger as well. I am the kind of person who suffers a lot silently in a relationship and then one day just blows up. I won\u0026rsquo;t attribute this entirely to ADHD, and this is something I did and do work on in therapy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m impulsive in many things, but it\u0026rsquo;s not all black and white. Being impulsive is not bad in itself; but what you\u0026rsquo;re being impulsive with determines a lot. I used to be very impulsive with money for example; if I\u0026rsquo;d have money left after my day-to-day expenses, I\u0026rsquo;d spend it on some electronics. A few years after I started earning money I discovered \u003ca href=\"https://www.youneedabudget.com/\"\u003eYNAB\u003c/a\u003e and budgeting — since then I\u0026rsquo;m like 50% less bad with money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp until very recently, I had a hard time saving money, though that\u0026rsquo;s also wrapped in anxieties you inherit when you grow up poor. Most of my working life, and especially in recent years I\u0026rsquo;ve been fairly privileged in earning a good chunk of money, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis brings me to my next topic, which explains many things, like the issue with saving money: I have a very myopic sense of time, not unlike one of a young child. It\u0026rsquo;s hard for me to think long-term in general: for me, there is \u003cem\u003enow\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003enot-now\u003c/em\u003e. Now is what needs my immediate attention. Not-now is something I can worry about \u003cem\u003elater\u003c/em\u003e. Sure I could save up, but that\u0026rsquo;s not-now, and that simply doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing a freelancer means having to manage my money and deal with sometimes irregular finances. Last year I got my first real long-term client, and that helped a lot. I could plan for things, and I have stumbled upon a stupid easy technique (besides budgeting) to stop myself from spending money that would be better saved for later: putting almost all my spare cash into deposits. It\u0026rsquo;s still available, and it\u0026rsquo;s only a few clicks away from being able to access it again, but those few clicks goes a long way to stop myself doing it. (They also earn an insultingly small amount of interest.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding motivation, one of the things that drive me most is a sense of novelty, which becomes my downfall as well. The dopamine hit it gives me is addictive. I find and start a new thing, I get immersed in it and I do it almost obsessively. Then the novelty wears off and I just stop doing it. I have a bazillion failed pet projects and abandoned hobbies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis addiction to novelty generates what I call \u0026ldquo;ADHD boredom\u0026rdquo;, though I\u0026rsquo;m sure there is a proper term for it. Let\u0026rsquo;s say it\u0026rsquo;s the weekend, and I got nothing scheduled, which is really, really bad. Now, I lie to myself, great! A free weekend! I can do anything! I can just rest. This is a trap. \u003cstrong\u003eHaving free time is a trap\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;just rest\u0026rdquo;. I am not capable of that and yet, even now I keep lying to myself that I can. I need to do things. And, while I could do about 10 different things — work on pet projects! draw! write! cook! etc. — oftentimes I can not bring myself to do anything. My brain, being the dopamine-junkie it is and frequently understimulated, wants something new (see also the section about spending money on shiny electronics above), and it just decided that. This is where we, once again, come back to the fact that I have a serious issue consciously focusing my attention on something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this is why I\u0026rsquo;ll frequently end up on the couch, mindlessly watching TV series or movies, and not even enjoying them, it\u0026rsquo;s really just to pass the time. It\u0026rsquo;s anything but \u003cem\u003eliving\u003c/em\u003e. I want to do \u003cem\u003eso many things\u003c/em\u003e and it really sucks that I just can\u0026rsquo;t oftentimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to be really disorganized, although that has improved a lot over the years, with the todo lists and other techniques I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned above. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me started about all the shame I picked up in school from teachers criticizing me for having a messy desk or my parent\u0026rsquo;s constant frustration of the mess in my room. Decluttering often makes things worse; nowadays I strive towards organized chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStructure and habits is an issue; it is a constant fight between being very rigid with my schedule/life/habits or just winging everything. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, I\u0026rsquo;m really good at improvising things, but it gets exhausting. On the other hand, starting a habit and sticking to habit is capital-h Hard, and so far I\u0026rsquo;ve found that for it to work long-term, it needs to be somewhat flexible, or I\u0026rsquo;ll just stop it after a few months if I get that far. That applies to writing as well; I don\u0026rsquo;t know how long I can keep up the 300 words a day thing. For now, it works, but I know there will come a point where it\u0026rsquo;ll feel like a prison (hey Owen can we have that vacation days feature sooner rather than later?).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeciding things can be really hard, excruciatingly hard. So far the only solution I\u0026rsquo;ve found is to, wait for it, just pick something. I know this is not helpful at all, but that\u0026rsquo;s where I\u0026rsquo;m at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this makes getting things done difficult, especially the mundane and monotonous. The techniques I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned in the previous paragraphs help. Deadlines help. I still procrastinate a lot, and to a certain degree I\u0026rsquo;ve accepted it, and I am working extremely hard not to beat myself up because of it. And oftentimes it\u0026rsquo;s productive procrastination; I do something useful and needed while avoiding something else. Like, writing this article.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to know more about what ADHD feels like, \u003ca href=\"https://gekk.info/articles/adhd.html\"\u003eread this\u003c/a\u003e because I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m just repeating things from this article.

It\u0026rsquo;s not a magic bullet, but as I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned above, it helps a lot in many things. It brings me to a baseline, just a tiny bit closer to neurotypical people, in terms of being able to get things done, especially the mundane, tedious things of life. It removes a certain amount of \u0026ldquo;fog\u0026rdquo; I feel in my brain without them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s important to note that ADHD does not exist in a vacuum. It can be and more often not is \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity\"\u003ecomorbid\u003c/a\u003e with a lot of other mental health issues. Anxiety, Depression, OCD and so on — \u003ca href=\"https://www.additudemag.com/when-its-not-just-adhd/\"\u003eyou can find a good article and list here\u003c/a\u003e. Everything I\u0026rsquo;ve just described can mostly be explained through the lens of ADHD, but definitely not exclusively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-rest-of-my-story\"\u003eThe rest of my story\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast time we saw our protagonist — about two dozen paragraphs ago — he got rediagnosed and started taking stimulant medication again. What could have possibly gone wrong?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlenty, as it turns out. A couple of months after starting my meds again, my lifelong untreated anxiety issues reached a breaking point, and I started having panic attacks. It forced me to seek help finally and so I did: I started a medication that helped me a lot, but I also had to take another break from Ritalin, one that would last a bit more, than a year. During that time, my anxiety issues improved, I moved to Sweden in January 2013, and I also started going to therapy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough a stroke of luck, I got to a government-funded psychiatrist pretty quickly in Sweden. What seems unreal looking back is that I literally walked into his office, told him my history over the next 90 minutes, discussed what medications I need and he simply prescribed them. I would later learn that this is almost an exception and a lot of places in the world want some sort of proof in writing, and they won\u0026rsquo;t just take your word for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so I was back on Ritalin once again, and it certainly helped things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s 2019 now, and a lot has changed. I\u0026rsquo;ve done therapy for almost six years. Right now I\u0026rsquo;m taking a break, one that\u0026rsquo;s necessary given that I finished up two relationships with two therapists within two months at the end of 2018 (long story).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cannot stress enough how much therapy — once you found the right therapist! — helps, not just with ADHD, but with just about\u0026hellip; everything? Nothing can replace doing the hard work of sifting through all your past issues and traumas that shaped you, especially in your childhood. It\u0026rsquo;s been life-changing for me, and I highly recommend it to literally everyone, if you can afford it and/or your insurance covers it. Once my break is over I will very likely continue the work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThere are also ADHD coaches, which I don\u0026rsquo;t have much experience with, but they are a thing, and many people find them helpful, though costly. Leave a comment if you\u0026rsquo;ve ever had one! I\u0026rsquo;d love to know more about those experiences.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ADHD medications I take has changed a bunch of times during those years, and right now I\u0026rsquo;m on a lowish dosage of Elvanse (Vyvanse) combined with some \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanfacine\"\u003eGuanfacine\u003c/a\u003e. I really wish instant-release Adderall would be available in Europe because based on my experience with all other past meds, I have a hunch that it\u0026rsquo;s the thing that would work for me the best, but until then I\u0026rsquo;ll work with what\u0026rsquo;s available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElvanse has a very different effect on me compared to Ritalin (I tried both IR, then XR, then a combination of both). The latter was effective, but it did raise my already high anxiety levels, and we could never quite compensate for that. There\u0026rsquo;s also the fact that high anxiety gives constant issues with my stomach acid. Ritalin had what my psychiatrist calls the \u0026ldquo;throat to the knife\u0026rdquo; effect; it helped me to get things done partly by giving me a specific kind of anxiety, not unlike to a strict parent standing over my shoulder threateningly. It does kinda work, but it is also not quite right. Oh yeah, and it also made me increasingly depressed and miserable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwitching to Elvanse was a revelation. I no longer have a knife to my throat, and my anxiety and depressiveness improved a lot. I\u0026rsquo;m also a lot less miserable and much happier in general; one of the things I noticed is that I\u0026rsquo;m laughing a lot more again. The downside of it is that many of my ADHD symptoms are a lot worse, especially my working memory and forgetfulness. I feel downright stupid sometimes. But for now, for me, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely worth the tradeoff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me finish this section with the important disclosure that while I share these experiences with the hope it helps others, it is a very well known fact among psychiatrists that people react to stimulant medication in wildly different ways. \u003cstrong\u003eWhat works for me may not work for you.\u003c/strong\u003e A good psychiatrist can help you find the right medication and the correct dosage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not list all the meds I take here, and stimulant medications are not the only medications for ADHD. Again, find a good psychiatrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eI would love to geek out more about ADHD medication with others and trade stories in private; find me on social media, I\u0026rsquo;m KTamas just about everywhere (except on \u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/user/ktamasenty\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"adhd-a-success-story\"\u003eADHD: a success story?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am \u003cstrong\u003ereally good at solving problems\u003c/strong\u003e and I have no issues whatsoever boasting about that. The other thing I am also really good at is learning new things, and learning them fast. If something interests me, I can jump on them, study them obsessively and get productive, fast. That\u0026rsquo;s literally at least half of why people hire me, even though \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know X but trust me I will learn it in a week, several people can attest to that\u0026rdquo; is a hard sell sometimes. But I make it work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m a freelancer, and half of my work comes by word-of-mouth: I work with people and then they recommend me to other people. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty damn good at selling myself because I have no shame or impostor syndrome when talking with prospective clients (I reserve those feelings to the rest of my time on earth). I\u0026rsquo;m also somewhat extraverted and good at networking. Going to conferences and networking the shit out of them is the other way I get jobs.

Indeed, before saying goodbye to my last therapist, he told me that in the grand scheme of things, the issues I attribute to ADHD are the minority of my actual problems in my life right now.

It does run in my family; several family members and some of my siblings have it.

			"content_text": "Owen [wrote about his journey with AD(H)D](https://writetogether.space/posts/owen/take-your-pills) and I figured I could tell my story as well, especially since no two AD(H)D stories are the same.\n\n*A note on terminology: I use ADHD, the [DSM-IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders) and up uses ADHD as well, with a note that not everyone is \"H.\" Instead, it has [subtypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#Subtypes): ADHD-PI, ADHD-PH and ADHD-C, but even these names have alternatives. Naming things is difficult, y'all.*\n\n### In the beginning...\n\nI was what they call a \"problem child\". From kindergarten, I had poor social skills: I would get bullied a lot, and I didn't have a lot of friends either. The first 8 years I attended a grand total of 5 different schools, which didn't help either, neither did the fact that I was fired from the penultimate one for said lack of social skills and my old school did not take me back for the same reason. I've spent most of the last 3 years homeschooled, and by homeschooled I mean being home mostly by myself, learning the material on my own and having tests at the end of each semester to get grades. I was a smart kid as well, and while I'd like to think I wasn't too obnoxious about it, I'm sure that didn't help, either.\n\n*(the homeschooling thing is a whole 'nother story which I'll not go into it here, but let me just say, it was, in some ways, genuinely helpful for me)*\n\nMy parents were not great at handling all this. They saw something was wrong early on, but couldn't for the life of them figure out what exactly, and how to fix it, so in many ways, they just made things worse. I was raised in a fairly strict fundamentalist Christian household, so they'd mostly respond with various forms of punishment, and yes that included corporal. \n\nWe have to take a small detour here: besides my ADHD, I've had undiagnosed anxiety issues and OCD as well. When most people hear OCD, they think of the shit you see in the movies: people closing the door precisely six times, obsessively cleaning things, etc. While there are cases that are like that, a lot, I repeat, a lot of people live with OCD where it mostly happens in their head. For me, that manifested in a lot of crazy irrational fears going around in my head on loop 24/7 and a sense of helplessness of me not being able to counter them. My OCD wouldn't get diagnosed until well into adulthood; I might write more on it later.\n\n### Getting diagnosed\n\nThis detour is crucial because ultimately my OCD was what lead to a huge meltdown I had when I was 12. I was _out of it_ for days, full of crazy fears (another story for another day) and my parents did not handle that too well either. After a few days, they took me to an inpatient psychiatric clinic, which was a pretty traumatic experience (once again, another story for another day) but they did finally diagnose me with ADHD and gave me medication for it (Ritalin IR 10mg, once or twice a day, can't quite remember). After this, I became homeschooled for the rest of elementary school (see above). My parents say I improved with medication.\n\nI went back to attending school in grade 9 for four years of high school. The first year was hell; I still had no social skills and still got bullied a lot. But something started to change in the second year, and by the end of that I had a group of friends, reasonable social skills,  wasn't bullied too much anymore, and the last two years of high school is something I genuinely enjoyed.\n\nAround the age of 16 or so, to the recommendation of my psychiatrist, my parents stopped giving me medication. My parents claim they switched to placebo and didn't notice a difference; to be fair, neither did I at the time. They said I \"grew out of it,\" which was a popular notion at the time. You also have to keep in mind that ADHD medication, research and pretty much everything usually lags at least 10-15 years behind the US in Hungary (and to a certain degree, in Europe). We know better, nowadays, that a lot of ADHD kids don't \"grow out of it\" and struggle through adulthood.\n\n---\n\nI worked as a journalist through high school and started freelancing with a translation agency as well, who hired me full-time after my graduation.\n\nThings went mostly well for the first few years; everything was new, and novelty is a huge motivational factor for ADHD. Working in the same office together with people is helpful too, not to mention deadlines. They did let me be a generalist and work at my own pace when client work was not involved. This was both a blessing and a curse; I didn't feel any unnecessary pressure, but in hindsight, I procrastinated a lot and beat myself up for it (I still do). I don't subscribe to the cult and fetishization of productivity, but that's a fact. A bit of nudge from someone goes a long way. I was suffering in a lot of different ways as well; I'll get back to these things later in this article.\n\n### Getting rediagnosed\n\nI was 21 when somehow, I genuinely don't remember how, I stumbled upon a book that'd change my life: [You Mean I'm Not Lazy, Stupid or Crazy?!: The Classic Self-Help Book for Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003719FSW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8\u0026btkr=1). I read it, and I immediately knew, I still had ADHD.\n\nI went through a long and arduous process of being rediagnosed, not unlike the one [Owen describes](https://writetogether.space/posts/owen/take-your-pills), so I'll skip the description of the process. For me it took weeks, and it kinda sucked, but in the end, I got my diagnosis and started medication once again. Ritalin IR, 10mg, twice a day.\n\n---\n\nLet's take a break here and talk more about ADHD itself and how it feels for me. Strap in; this might take a while.\n\n### Talking about ADHD and what is it anyway?\n\nLet me start by saying that it's hard to talk to people about your ADHD and its symptoms. *A lot* of people will brush it or its symptoms off with things like \"oh yeah I procrastinate too,\" \"yeah sometimes I forget where my keys are\" or \"yeah I can't motivate myself to do boring things.\" I could go on.\n\nADHD is not about whether you procrastinate, forget your keys, or have a hard time doing boring things, among other things. To get a diagnosis, you have to meet a certain set of criteria, and they have to do with a lot of different things and *more importantly, the severity of them*. That is what most people don't realize when they say things like the ones I listed above. You can find [DSM-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders)'s fairly good criteria listed [here](https://www.addrc.org/dsm-5-criteria-for-adhd/).\n\n*I will explicitly not go into the \"is ADHD being overdiagnosed/are our kids being overmedicated\" debate — that'd be an entire post in itself.*\n\nADHD is the utter, extremely frustrating inability to focus on something that you consciously wants to. Your brain, through a variety of factors, decides what to focus on by itself and you have very limited say in that. This is one of the reasons Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder is a terrible name: I don't have a deficit of attention, I just can't focus it like [neurotypical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotypical) people do. \n\nBiologically, people with ADHD have the [prefrontal cortex of their brain all messed up](https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-brain-prefrontal-cortex-attention-emotions/). That's the part regulating thoughts, feelings, impulses. The linked article gives a really good overview on that as well.\n\nThe other big biological factor is [not having enough dopamine](https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/adhd-dopamine) in your brain, which is where most stimulant medication help. [This ADDitude magazine article](https://www.additudemag.com/stimulant-medications-for-adhd/) has a good overview on them.\n\nA large part of ADHD is what they call Executive Dysfunction (ED). [This article has a good overview of it](https://www.additudemag.com/7-executive-function-deficits-linked-to-adhd/); the parts that *I find affecting me* are issues with inhibition, working memory, emotional self-regulation, self-motivation and to a certain degree, planning. Let me extend on these.\n\n### How ADHD feels like and looks like to me\n\nIssues with emotional self-regulation manifest in me with a sense of being constantly bombarded by and feeling helpless against overwhelming emotions, especially the negative ones. I am particularly extremely sensitive to rejection.\n\nMy long-term memory is pretty great, however my short-term (working) memory is absolutely terrible. With my attention frequently being as bad as a butterfly — insert \"look, squirrel!\" joke here — it's very easy to get lost in my thoughts and forget things. \n\nThere are things that help with this. Medication helps. Writing todo lists help. Breaking things down into subtasks help. Sticking to said todo-lists is eternally work-in-progress.\n\n\"Oh I don't need to write this down, I will remember it\" is the biggest lie I keep telling myself, and I still fall for it. If I know I need something done and/or remembered, I'll 1. add it to my calendar 2. add it to my weekly todo list 3. make a reminder for it 4. if it's more important, make 2 or 3 reminders for it, because sometimes I just ignore the first reminder and forget about the whole thing.\n\n---\n\nProblems around inhibition and impulsivity are abound. A lot of times, particularly with people, I either just close myself up completely or end up at the other extreme: blurt things out without thinking or start oversharing (people who know me and are reading this are heavily nodding at this point). For me, this applies to anger as well. I am the kind of person who suffers a lot silently in a relationship and then one day just blows up. I won't attribute this entirely to ADHD, and this is something I did and do work on in therapy.\n\nI'm impulsive in many things, but it's not all black and white. Being impulsive is not bad in itself; but what you're being impulsive with determines a lot. I used to be very impulsive with money for example; if I'd have money left after my day-to-day expenses, I'd spend it on some electronics. A few years after I started earning money I discovered [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) and budgeting — since then I'm like 50% less bad with money. \n\nUp until very recently, I had a hard time saving money, though that's also wrapped in anxieties you inherit when you grow up poor. Most of my working life, and especially in recent years I've been fairly privileged in earning a good chunk of money, though.\n\n---\n\nThis brings me to my next topic, which explains many things, like the issue with saving money: I have a very myopic sense of time, not unlike one of a young child. It's hard for me to think long-term in general: for me, there is *now* and *not-now*. Now is what needs my immediate attention. Not-now is something I can worry about *later*. Sure I could save up, but that's not-now, and that simply doesn't exist.\n\nBeing a freelancer means having to manage my money and deal with sometimes irregular finances. Last year I got my first real long-term client, and that helped a lot. I could plan for things, and I have stumbled upon a stupid easy technique (besides budgeting) to stop myself from spending money that would be better saved for later: putting almost all my spare cash into deposits. It's still available, and it's only a few clicks away from being able to access it again, but those few clicks goes a long way to stop myself doing it. (They also earn an insultingly small amount of interest.)\n\nRegarding motivation, one of the things that drive me most is a sense of novelty, which becomes my downfall as well. The dopamine hit it gives me is addictive. I find and start a new thing, I get immersed in it and I do it almost obsessively. Then the novelty wears off and I just stop doing it. I have a bazillion failed pet projects and abandoned hobbies.\n\nThis addiction to novelty generates what I call \"ADHD boredom\", though I'm sure there is a proper term for it. Let's say it's the weekend, and I got nothing scheduled, which is really, really bad. Now, I lie to myself, great! A free weekend! I can do anything! I can just rest. This is a trap. **Having free time is a trap**.\n\nI can't \"just rest\". I am not capable of that and yet, even now I keep lying to myself that I can. I need to do things. And, while I could do about 10 different things — work on pet projects! draw! write! cook! etc. — oftentimes I can not bring myself to do anything. My brain, being the dopamine-junkie it is and frequently understimulated, wants something new (see also the section about spending money on shiny electronics above), and it just decided that. This is where we, once again, come back to the fact that I have a serious issue consciously focusing my attention on something.\n\nAnd this is why I'll frequently end up on the couch, mindlessly watching TV series or movies, and not even enjoying them, it's really just to pass the time. It's anything but *living*. I want to do *so many things* and it really sucks that I just can't oftentimes.\n\n---\n\nI used to be really disorganized, although that has improved a lot over the years, with the todo lists and other techniques I've mentioned above. Don't get me started about all the shame I picked up in school from teachers criticizing me for having a messy desk or my parent's constant frustration of the mess in my room. Decluttering often makes things worse; nowadays I strive towards organized chaos.\n\nStructure and habits is an issue; it is a constant fight between being very rigid with my schedule/life/habits or just winging everything. Don't get me wrong, I'm really good at improvising things, but it gets exhausting. On the other hand, starting a habit and sticking to habit is capital-h Hard, and so far I've found that for it to work long-term, it needs to be somewhat flexible, or I'll just stop it after a few months if I get that far. That applies to writing as well; I don't know how long I can keep up the 300 words a day thing. For now, it works, but I know there will come a point where it'll feel like a prison (hey Owen can we have that vacation days feature sooner rather than later?).\n\nDeciding things can be really hard, excruciatingly hard. So far the only solution I've found is to, wait for it, just pick something. I know this is not helpful at all, but that's where I'm at.\n\nAll of this makes getting things done difficult, especially the mundane and monotonous. The techniques I've mentioned in the previous paragraphs help. Deadlines help. I still procrastinate a lot, and to a certain degree I've accepted it, and I am working extremely hard not to beat myself up because of it. And oftentimes it's productive procrastination; I do something useful and needed while avoiding something else. Like, writing this article.\n\n---\n\nIf you want to know more about what ADHD feels like, [read this](https://gekk.info/articles/adhd.html) because I feel like I'm just repeating things from this article. I am legit scared to open it now before I publish this because that'd make this post about twice as long.\n\n### Being on meds and also, ADHD is not alone\n\nTaking stimulant medication the first time in my adult life was life-changing. It's not a magic bullet, but as I've mentioned above, it helps a lot in many things. It brings me to a baseline, just a tiny bit closer to neurotypical people, in terms of being able to get things done, especially the mundane, tedious things of life. It removes a certain amount of \"fog\" I feel in my brain without them.\n\nIt's important to note that ADHD does not exist in a vacuum. It can be and more often not is [comorbid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity) with a lot of other mental health issues. Anxiety, Depression, OCD and so on — [you can find a good article and list here](https://www.additudemag.com/when-its-not-just-adhd/). Everything I've just described can mostly be explained through the lens of ADHD, but definitely not exclusively.\n\n### The rest of my story\n\nLast time we saw our protagonist — about two dozen paragraphs ago — he got rediagnosed and started taking stimulant medication again. What could have possibly gone wrong?\n\nPlenty, as it turns out. A couple of months after starting my meds again, my lifelong untreated anxiety issues reached a breaking point, and I started having panic attacks. It forced me to seek help finally and so I did: I started a medication that helped me a lot, but I also had to take another break from Ritalin, one that would last a bit more, than a year. During that time, my anxiety issues improved, I moved to Sweden in January 2013, and I also started going to therapy.\n\nThrough a stroke of luck, I got to a government-funded psychiatrist pretty quickly in Sweden. What seems unreal looking back is that I literally walked into his office, told him my history over the next 90 minutes, discussed what medications I need and he simply prescribed them. I would later learn that this is almost an exception and a lot of places in the world want some sort of proof in writing, and they won't just take your word for it. \n\nAnd so I was back on Ritalin once again, and it certainly helped things.\n\n---\n\nIt's 2019 now, and a lot has changed. I've done therapy for almost six years. Right now I'm taking a break, one that's necessary given that I finished up two relationships with two therapists within two months at the end of 2018 (long story).\n\nI cannot stress enough how much therapy — once you found the right therapist! — helps, not just with ADHD, but with just about... everything? Nothing can replace doing the hard work of sifting through all your past issues and traumas that shaped you, especially in your childhood. It's been life-changing for me, and I highly recommend it to literally everyone, if you can afford it and/or your insurance covers it. Once my break is over I will very likely continue the work.\n\n*There are also ADHD coaches, which I don't have much experience with, but they are a thing, and many people find them helpful, though costly. Leave a comment if you've ever had one! I'd love to know more about those experiences.*\n\nThe ADHD medications I take has changed a bunch of times during those years, and right now I'm on a lowish dosage of Elvanse (Vyvanse) combined with some [Guanfacine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanfacine). I really wish instant-release Adderall would be available in Europe because based on my experience with all other past meds, I have a hunch that it's the thing that would work for me the best, but until then I'll work with what's available.\n\nElvanse has a very different effect on me compared to Ritalin (I tried both IR, then XR, then a combination of both). The latter was effective, but it did raise my already high anxiety levels, and we could never quite compensate for that. There's also the fact that high anxiety gives constant issues with my stomach acid. Ritalin had what my psychiatrist calls the \"throat to the knife\" effect; it helped me to get things done partly by giving me a specific kind of anxiety, not unlike to a strict parent standing over my shoulder threateningly. It does kinda work, but it is also not quite right. Oh yeah, and it also made me increasingly depressed and miserable.\n\nSwitching to Elvanse was a revelation. I no longer have a knife to my throat, and my anxiety and depressiveness improved a lot. I'm also a lot less miserable and much happier in general; one of the things I noticed is that I'm laughing a lot more again. The downside of it is that many of my ADHD symptoms are a lot worse, especially my working memory and forgetfulness. I feel downright stupid sometimes. But for now, for me, it's definitely worth the tradeoff.\n\nLet me finish this section with the important disclosure that while I share these experiences with the hope it helps others, it is a very well known fact among psychiatrists that people react to stimulant medication in wildly different ways. **What works for me may not work for you.** A good psychiatrist can help you find the right medication and the correct dosage.\n\n---\n\nI did not list all the meds I take here, and stimulant medications are not the only medications for ADHD. Again, find a good psychiatrist.\n\n*I would love to geek out more about ADHD medication with others and trade stories in private; find me on social media, I'm KTamas just about everywhere (except on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/user/ktamasenty)).*\n\n### ADHD: a success story?\n\nI am **really good at solving problems** and I have no issues whatsoever boasting about that. The other thing I am also really good at is learning new things, and learning them fast. If something interests me, I can jump on them, study them obsessively and get productive, fast. That's literally at least half of why people hire me, even though \"I don't know X but trust me I will learn it in a week, several people can attest to that\" is a hard sell sometimes. But I make it work.\n\nI'm a freelancer, and half of my work comes by word-of-mouth: I work with people and then they recommend me to other people. I'm pretty damn good at selling myself because I have no shame or impostor syndrome when talking with prospective clients (I reserve those feelings to the rest of my time on earth). I'm also somewhat extraverted and good at networking. Going to conferences and networking the shit out of them is the other way I get jobs. That's my \"secret\" for having a successful freelancing business for three years and counting. \n\nThat, and the fact that — by far and large — I do good work, or so my clients tell me.\n\n---\n\nMany of the traits and skills I described are frequently attributed to ADHD, which would bring me to my next point: **ADHD doesn't get to define me**. It is a diagnosis and a label. Used wisely, it's an explanation but never an excuse.\n\nI struggle with some other mental health issues with as well, and none of them are isolated; as I've mentioned before, comorbidity plays a significant role. Indeed, before saying goodbye to my last therapist, he told me that in the grand scheme of things, the issues I attribute to ADHD are the minority of my actual problems in my life right now. And I'm pretty sure he is right.\n\n### Closing remarks\n\nThere are a lot of things I have not touched upon these articles, but I hope it will at least get you thinking. It's still something that in some ways is still underdiagnosed.\n\nADHD is not a life sentence; having a diagnosis, a good psychiatrist, a good therapist, a good coach (ideally, all of them) can improve things tremendously.\n\nThe origins of ADHD is something that's still unclear, with many theories going around and consensus on it. It *seems* that in *some way* it's hereditary, but the jury is still very much out on how much of it is nature and how much of it may be nurture. It does run in my family; several family members and some of my siblings have it. I'd be lying if I'd say I'm not worried that some of my kids may grow up with it, too. One of the books I'm recommending below has an interesting theory that very much fits my life story; however that doesn't mean it's the definitive answer.\n\nA very important caveat to everything I wrote about, and especially the part on how ADHD feels like to me is heavily colored by the fact that I'm a guy. ADHD for women can and does look very different oftentimes; [ADDitude magazine has an article to get you started reading up on it](https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-symptoms-in-women/).\n\n---\n\nI'd be remiss if I wouldn't acknowledge the fact that, depending on where you live and what your financial situation is, all of the above can be very expensive and a lot of people simply can't afford that. I know I am in a very privileged position to do so, and it sucks that I don't have a solution for those who don't.\n\nI hope you found these posts informative; I'm happy to answer questions in the comments, social media or in private.\n\n### Epilogue: a reading list\n\nA while ago, I compiled a list of books that helped me learn about ADHD. Maybe it'll help you, too.\n\n[You Mean I'm Not Lazy, Stupid or Crazy?!: The Classic Self-Help Book for Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder](https://www.amazon.com/You-Mean-Lazy-Stupid-Crazy/dp/0743264487/)  \nIt is the classic self-help book and an excellent first read to get you into the topic.\n\n[Delivered from Distraction: Getting the Most out of Life with Attention Deficit Disorder](https://www.amazon.com/Delivered-Distraction-Getting-Attention-Disorder/dp/0345442318/)  \nThis is an excellent book to follow up the first with if you are not overwhelmed already. It is technically the second book in a series (the first one being Driven to Distraction) but stands on its own.\n\n[Your Life Can Be Better: using strategies for Adult ADD/ADHD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006QL0VJC/)\nThis is excellent and practical, structured into concise chapters. After you get your dose of theory (and strategies) from the first two books, this gives you a whole lot more that are helpful.\n\n[Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates and What You Can Do About It](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UZDTFG/)  \nI believe this is *one of the most important books* I've read about ADHD. It has changed my view on it profoundly, and I consider it a must-read. It has sections on both childhood, and adult ADHD and his two chapters about nurturing your inner child are something I re-read every couple of months. \n\nThe book poses the theory that ADHD is a combination of being born with an above-average sensitivity to outside impulses and early childhood trauma, primarily the lack of proper attachment/attunement to the caregiver parent (typically the mother). Again, this fits me; but it may not fit you, and it's not that mainstream. Then again, mainstream is still pretty scattered — pun not intended — on the origins of ADHD.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSaturday, 2 Feb 2019\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/02/02/re-take-your-pills-my-story-of-adhd/\n\nMore about...\n\n* adhd:         https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/adhd/\n* series:       https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/series/\n* mentalhealth: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/mentalhealth/"

I spent my free time today working my converting my blog from Wordpress to Hugo — with a detour of Jekyll — and moving my static sites to Netlify so that I can shut down my barely-used VPS. A full write-up about this is coming soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have about 20 minutes before said friends arrive so this will be one of those stream of consciousness posts where I just start writing and see what comes out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the longest time, I did not like neither beer nor wine. Sure, both are acquired tastes, but I tried plenty (especially beer) and it just never clicked. To this day the only beer I drink is alcohol-free lager since it\u0026rsquo;s the one that tastes the least like actual beer and it has the advantage of, well, not having alcohol in it. If I wanted to get tipsy or drunk I would go with shots or cocktails. That changed in recent years, though; I finally got a taste of wine, dry red wine, to be exact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mentioned a bunch of times already that in 2012 my untreated anxiety disorder got to the point where I started having panic attacks and forced me to seek treatment. One of the side-effects of all this is that my stomach was shot. I had severe discomfort/pain for months; at one point, someone accidentally figured out that the primary cause was high stomach acid and antacid pills help. Slowly, I started recovering. To aid the process and my digestion (in retrospect, maybe my anxiety as well), my old GP, who was somewhat old-school prescribed me a deciliter of red wine, every day, after lunch. It\u0026rsquo;s not like I had anything to lose, and it\u0026rsquo;s not enough alcohol to get me tipsy anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I did that for like two months, and after a few weeks, I started not hating red wine. A few weeks after that, I was a convert. Since then it became my go-to drink of choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t know much about wine. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s good\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;It sucks\u0026rdquo; is as far as I can go. I did develop preferences over the years; by far and large, I like a good Merlot or Pinot Noir. Above all, Shiraz (Syrah) wines, mostly from Australia and New Zealand are among my favorites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I lived in Sweden, I had the luxury of having a selection of 100s of different wines from at least 20 different countries. See, in Sweden, there is a government monopoly on selling alcohol above 3.5%; you can only buy the serious stuff in state-run alcohol shops. The pros and cons of this system are beyond the scope of this post, but one huge pro was the selection I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m back in Hungary now, and though there are stores where you can get import wine, most of the wine here is local. Which is not a bad thing, of course; Hungarian is a wine country, and our wine is renowned for its quality.

			"content_text": "I'm sitting in a wine bar and waiting for my friends to arrive to hang out. I spent my free time today working my converting my blog from Wordpress to Hugo — with a detour of Jekyll — and moving my static sites to Netlify so that I can shut down my barely-used VPS. A full write-up about this is coming soon.\n\nI have about 20 minutes before said friends arrive so this will be one of those stream of consciousness posts where I just start writing and see what comes out of it. \n\n---\n\nFor the longest time, I did not like neither beer nor wine. Sure, both are acquired tastes, but I tried plenty (especially beer) and it just never clicked. To this day the only beer I drink is alcohol-free lager since it's the one that tastes the least like actual beer and it has the advantage of, well, not having alcohol in it. If I wanted to get tipsy or drunk I would go with shots or cocktails. That changed in recent years, though; I finally got a taste of wine, dry red wine, to be exact.\n\n---\n\nI mentioned a bunch of times already that in 2012 my untreated anxiety disorder got to the point where I started having panic attacks and forced me to seek treatment. One of the side-effects of all this is that my stomach was shot. I had severe discomfort/pain for months; at one point, someone accidentally figured out that the primary cause was high stomach acid and antacid pills help. Slowly, I started recovering. To aid the process and my digestion (in retrospect, maybe my anxiety as well), my old GP, who was somewhat old-school prescribed me a deciliter of red wine, every day, after lunch. It's not like I had anything to lose, and it's not enough alcohol to get me tipsy anyway.\n\nSo I did that for like two months, and after a few weeks, I started not hating red wine. A few weeks after that, I was a convert. Since then it became my go-to drink of choice.\n\n---\n\nI don't know much about wine. \"It's good\" or \"It sucks\" is as far as I can go. I did develop preferences over the years; by far and large, I like a good Merlot or Pinot Noir. Above all, Shiraz (Syrah) wines, mostly from Australia and New Zealand are among my favorites.\n\nWhen I lived in Sweden, I had the luxury of having a selection of 100s of different wines from at least 20 different countries. See, in Sweden, there is a government monopoly on selling alcohol above 3.5%; you can only buy the serious stuff in state-run alcohol shops. The pros and cons of this system are beyond the scope of this post, but one huge pro was the selection I've mentioned above.\n\n---\n\nI'm back in Hungary now, and though there are stores where you can get import wine, most of the wine here is local. Which is not a bad thing, of course; Hungarian is a wine country, and our wine is renowned for its quality. I do miss being able to pick from all the different countries, though.\n\n---\n\nMy friends started arriving. Time for me to order a glass of Syrah...\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThursday, 31 Jan 2019\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/01/31/on-wine-and-anxiety/\n\nMore about...\n\n* writersblock: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/writersblock/\n* wine:         https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/wine/"

So we ended up going together, our cameras in hand, to take a few pictures; seemed like an interesting enough topic.

I had that notebook with me religiously, in my right pocket, next to my wallet and in the next year and a half, I filled several of them. My favorite was the Evernote edition, which is not sold anymore. It gave you three months of Evernote premium but more importantly, it had nice, light, dot-grid pages which quickly became my favorite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept writing in my notebooks until the start of 2015 when I went digital and started writing all the things down in Evernote. Now, Evernote is by no means a perfect app: it\u0026rsquo;s bloated, slow and clumsy in many ways. And yet to this day, I have found no suitable replacement for it.

Plus it\u0026rsquo;s available for every platform ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI usually make a note a day with the title being the current date.

In each note, I have each day and a \u0026ldquo;Later\u0026rdquo; section, and I try to add as many things as possible because it gives me a sense of achievement and it\u0026rsquo;s nice to look back on days when I thought I got nothing done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eP.S. Thinking in weeks is a very Swedish thing to do. In Sweden, everyone knows what week it is, and they frequently refer to them as in \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m doing this on week X\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll be on vacation between week Y and Z.\u0026rdquo; If my memory serves me right, one of the most popular apps in the Swedish App Store for a long time was called \u0026ldquo;Week Calendar\u0026rdquo; until Apple added the option to display week numbers in Calendar.

So I got myself a cheap Moto G5 Plus just to play around with it, and to my surprise, I promptly fell in love with the whole thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndroid has come a long way, and in many ways, it\u0026rsquo;s a better fit for me than iOS. I like the (relative) openness of it, the way it handles notifications, the ability to turn off animations (I hate UI animations with a passion), the customizability in general, better integration with Google and so on. The G5 Plus shipped with 7.0 Nougat, with the promise of an Oreo upgrade coming in late 2017, which arrived at the end of 2018 and made an otherwise fast phone somewhat slow. It ships with a vanilla version of Android, with a few enhancements from Motorola that are actually useful: a few gestures (for example, shake twice for flashlight) and a really good implementation of an active display (you can preview and even dismiss notifications from it very quickly). Oh and it had a great battery life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone did have one major flaw: the camera sucks. It\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip; passable at best, but even with the best daylight conditions, pictures simple look off at best, because of Motorola applying some extremely aggressive sharpening. Low-light performance? What low-light performance?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I replaced it with a Pixel 2 which, at the time had the best camera on the market (it still is one of the best ones) and it was pretty great, except the GPS in it was pretty shitty, and I was used to using my phones for running. After it spending literally months in repair \u0026ndash; which is hard in a country where you can only buy grey market imports; mine is from Canada \u0026ndash;, going back and forth and getting nowhere, I just got fed up with the whole thing and sold it. Only later I learned that many of the high-end phones lately come with shitty GPSes and if you wanna go running, you better buy yourself a running watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, I decided to jump back to iOS and got myself an iPhone X, about two months before the fall keynote. I figured I\u0026rsquo;d replace it with the new model when it comes out but the XS is a ridiculously incremental upgrade and I have no desire whatsoever to spend money upgrading. Maybe next fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe X also has a good camera, and the optical 2x zoom should be mandatory on phones; its portrait mode is, in my experience, ever-so-slightly better than the Pixel 2\u0026rsquo;s (its low light performance, on the other hand, is miles behind).

It has two-thirds of The IT Crowd and also Michelle Wolf, among others.\n\nOnwards to 2019!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMonday, 31 Dec 2018\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2018/12/31/my-recent-media-diet-on-the-last-days-of-2018/\n\nMore about...\n\n* thoughts:        https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/thoughts/\n* mediadiet:       https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/mediadiet/\n* recommendations: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/recommendations/"

The first few months were much harder, than I thought it would be, with the newfound freedom bringing much more free time, but a lot of stress, financial and otherwise. However, now I am six months in, and I have already worked with several clients, sorted out accounting (ugh), realized it’s a really bad idea to have my work e-mail mixed with my personal ones, and I’m heading to Southern Europe for 2 months in a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got a two-month consulting gig at a translation agency doing some integration work (read: software development) with their workflow system, customer portal and a popular CAT tool. Perks include being in warm and sunny Barcelona for a week and in even warmer and sunnier Bologna afterwards. I even get to have a mini-vacation in Marseille just before, courtesy of a very good friend of mine who has a flat there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"photography\"\u003ePhotography\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have written a neat little gear post about three times now, but I am never satisfied with it, so here’s the short version with some links, and a longer one coming soon (or not).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn January I got an \u003ca href=\"http://www.eyefi.com/products/mobi\"\u003eEye-Fi Mobi\u003c/a\u003e card, turning my 6D into a ginourmous point-and-shoot that sends all the pictures I take to my iPhone in 20 seconds. It is perfect for JPEG shooting (way too slow for RAW work), and gave several month’s of motivation to lug my DSLR around everywhere with me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn my iPhone 6 Plus (yes, it’s big; but the camera, the battery and the screen real estate makes up for it, most of the time) I use the built-in Photos app for cropping picture and VSCO for editing; it handles the 22mpx files surprisingly well. Even with its limits and the occasional crashes, I have found \u003ca href=\"https://vsco.co/vscocam\"\u003eVSCO\u003c/a\u003e to be by far the best photo editor on mobile, and I have tried plenty other (Afterlight, Darkroom, Enlight etc.). Hell, I bought most of the filter packs, even though usually I loathe spending money on In-app purchases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother permanent addition to my camera bag is the \u003ca href=\"http://www.fujifilm.com/products/instant_photo/printers/instax_share_sp_1/\"\u003eFuji Instax Share\u003c/a\u003e printer, that prints 2×3″ pictures from my smartphone onto Fuji Instax Mini film. It’s expensive, the film is expensive and the quality is okay at best and I do not care about any of these, because it is fucking magic. I can take a picture on my 6D, have it on my phone, print it out, and give it to the person I took the picture of, in about 2 minutes. That is something you can not measure in money. It is also an excellent ice-breaker in a many social situations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast but not least, with the help of my friend Krisztián I fell in love with Fuji’s X series ILC cameras, having used an \u003ca href=\"http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x_e1/\"\u003eX-E1\u003c/a\u003e and the \u003ca href=\"http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf35mmf14_r/\"\u003e35mm f/1.4\u003c/a\u003e for a few days when I was in Budapest in May. Afterwards I got myself the newer X-E2, but I quickly realized that I hate the new sensor’s colors and tones, not to mention the dreadful “plastic skin” issue on the JPEGs (\u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=fuji+plastic+skin\"\u003egoogle fuji plastic skin\u003c/a\u003e, if you are interested…), in which noise reduction goes crazy and makes you look like a wax figure. So I returned the X-E2, got myself a new-old-stock X-E1 with the kit \u003ca href=\"http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf18_55mmf28_4_r_lm_ois/\"\u003e18-55mm f/2.8-4\u003c/a\u003e lens, which is an excellent, excellent lens. I have my eyes set on the \u003ca href=\"http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf56mmf12_r/\"\u003e56mm f/1.2\u003c/a\u003e and the one of the ultrawide lenses, but that’s for another time. Fuji helps you to be careful with your lens purchases by making them really expensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe X-E1 may have a slower EVF and autofocus than the X-E2, but it makes gorgeous black and white JPEGs that are the best I have ever seen. My 6D’s JPEGs look rubbish in comparison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of my pictures nowadays end up on my \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KTamas\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/ktamasenty/\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e accounts, so add me there, if you are interested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"languages\"\u003eLanguages\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now I got to a “shitty conversational” level with Swedish, with \u003ca href=\"http://duolingo.com\"\u003eDuolingo\u003c/a\u003e‘s course being a big help sorting out some of my grammar issues and expanding my vocabulary a bit. I still lack practice and construct sentences in English in my head, but it is progress. With practice, it will improve, and I am not in a hurry. Also, by now I am pretty good at understanding Swedish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also started learning Ukrainian (on Duolingo, of course). I have many Russian-speaking friends (most of them are from Ukraine or Latvia) and I want to be able to talk with them without a lot of Google/Yandex Translate. I also like languages, so why not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why Ukrainian, and not Russian, asks everyone? Because I was interested and they don’t have a Russian course on Duolingo yet, that’s why and Duolingo is pretty much the only language-learning software that keeps me motivated enough. Ukrainian is also a beautiful language (Russian is somewhat less so, in my not-so-humble opinion), and a bit easier; also, most of my Russian-speaking friends can understand and/or speak Ukrainian. Meanwhile I pick up a fair amount of Russian just by listening to them speaking. It can be hard to keep the two languages separate in my head, but at this point, it helps that I can mix them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not an easy language: the grammar has similarities to Hungarian with three genders (okay, we don’t have genders in Hungarian), an excessive number of cases and conjugations, virtually no fixed word order, and euphony (but we do have all of these).

It\u0026#8217;s a good package deal.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThursday, 19 Feb 2015\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2015/02/19/%d0%be%d0%b4%d0%bd%d1%96%d1%94%d1%97-%d0%bc%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b8-%d0%bd%d1%96%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b8-%d0%bd%d0%b5-%d0%b4%d0%be%d1%81%d0%b8%d1%82%d1%8c/\n\nMore about...\n\n* 2015:      https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/2015/\n* ontheroad: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/ontheroad/"

Hármas számú emberünk azt mondja, hogy igen, persze, el lehet ezt intézni, telefonáljak holnap reggel.\n\n_Negyedik nap_\n\nKedd. Telefonálok délután, négyes számú ember azt mondja, hogy küldjem el erre és erre az email címre a munkaszerződésem meg a telefonszámom, ő majd intézkedik és visszahív (nem) amint megvan. Elküldöm neki, várok (öreg hiba).\n\n_Ötödik nap_\n\nSzerda. Délután kezdek türelmetlen lenni, telefonálok, és addig verem a virtuális asztalt amíg el nem jutok legalább odáig, hogy a telefonon lévő ötös számú ember beszél (?) a négyes számú emberemmel aki megerősíti, hogy hív, amint megvan.\n\n_Hatodik nap_\n\nCsütörtök. Ugye senki se lepődik meg, hogy még mindig semmi hír? Telefonálok megint, hatos számú emberünknek előadom a sztorim (sokadszorra), átkapcsol a saleshez ahol hetes számú emberünk felajánlja majd ő elintézi ezt az egészet, megadja a saját email címét\u0026#8230; nem inkább adjam meg a sajátom\u0026#8230; nem, itt van nyitva egy emailkliens, küldöm azonnal, mondd csak szépen. Munkaszerződés megint elküldve, megigérí hív aznap este vagy legkésőbb másnap reggel.\n\n_Hetedik nap_\n\nPéntek. 11 körül szól egy kollégám, hogy amúgy reggel hívta a céget valaki valamelik creditcégtől, oké, végre, haladunk. A várt telefonhívás azonban csak nem jön, délután háromkor újra telefonálok. Nyolcas számú emberünk közli velem, hogy hetes számú emberem ma betegszabadságon van, és hát csak az ő számítógépén van meg a jóváhagyásom. Aha persze, ilyen nincs, csak van valaki, aki valahogy meg tudja szerezni a dolgot. Fél perccel később azt mondja a csaj, idézem, \u0026#8220;I pressed some buttons on my computers and now you are approved!\u0026#8221; (\u0026#8220;Megnyomtam pár gombot a számítógépen, és mostmár jóvá vagy hagyva!\u0026#8221;). Ezen a ponton már nem érdekel, hogy csinálta, tíz perc alatt letolom a szerződéskötést, és van újra internetem.\n\nA tanulság kábé az, hogy az internetszolgáltatók mindenhol internetszolgáltatók, sose higgyük el, ha valaki azt mondja, hogy visszahív, és ne hagyjuk magunkat lerázni.\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/gqDvLeG1pgU?rel=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSaturday, 10 May 2014\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2014/05/10/internet-lol-internet-dsl-und-world-wide-web-2014-03-24/\n\nMore about...\n\n* én:         https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9n/\n* énblog:     https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9nblog/\n* svédország: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/sv%C3%A9dorsz%C3%A1g/"

Csak két évet írtam meg, de az is több a semminél, valamint az egész szerintem tök érdekes. Eredetileg tán a Kalcsán jelent volna meg.)_\n\nElkezdődött tehát a 2000-es év, és ahogy az előző években a Y2K kapcsán többen megjegyezték, január elsején leálltak a bankok, eljött az apokalipszis és megtörtént az elragadtatás.\n\nMíg 1999-ben csak kb. 4 hónapnyi interjút kellett feldolgozni, itt rögtön egy egész évet, és ahogy haladunk előre az időben, úgy lesz egyre nehezebb válogatni: így, bár valószínű nem kell külön mondani, ez a lista egyre szubjektívebb lesz.\n\n[Corel CEO Michael Cowpland](http://interviews.slashdot.org/story/00/01/21/0856206/interview-corel-ceo-michael-cowpland-answers). Tudtátok, hogy a Corelnek volt pár évig egy [Debian-alapú desktoplinuxa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corel_Linux)? Sőt, aktívan dolgoztak a szoftvereik ezen platformra portolásán is, eléggé felemás módon, mert mind a WordPerfect, mind a CorelDRAW utolsó linuxos verziója Wine alatt futott, és emiatt komoly problémák voltak vele.\n\n[DVD Jon](http://yro.slashdot.org/story/00/02/04/1133241/jon-johansens-answers-to-your-decss-questions). Ő írta a híres DeCSS programot, ami lerántotta a DVD-kről a \u003cdel\u003eDRM-et\u003c/del\u003e másolásvédelmet, hogy le lehessen játszani őket Linuxon, merthogy addig Hollywood nem nagyon akart kiadni lejátszóprogramot arra a platformra. Persze azonnal beperelték, [de sikertelenül](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvd_jon#The_DeCSS_prosecution), bár négy évig húzódott az ügy. Érdemes megjegyezni, hogy a DRM egyszer sem hangzik el az interjúba, csak a másolásvédelem; a kifejezés a 00-es években lett népszerű.\n\n[Philip Greenspun](http://tech.slashdot.org/story/00/04/27/107235/philip-greenspun-answers). Bajban vagyok, mert ő egy külön posztot érdemelne minimum, de azért megpróbálom pár mondatban összefoglalni a csókát. 1993-ban megalapította a [photo.net](http://photo.net)-et (ami azóta is él és virul, bár már pár éve túladott rajta), valamint ő volt az egyik alapítója az ArsDigitának (ami sajnos [szomorú véget ért](http://waxy.org/random/arsdigita/) nem sokkal az interjú után). A kérdések többsége viszont két másik projektjéről, az [ArsDigita University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArsDigita_University) és a [Travels with Samanthá](http://philip.greenspun.com/samantha/)ról szólnak. Greenspun az utóbbi időkben rákapott a repülésre és a helikopterekre, valamint [blogol](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/), rendkívül jól. Böngésszétek a [wikioldalát](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Greenspun) is, megéri.\n\n[SCO](http://tech.slashdot.org/story/00/05/05/0713234/sco-answers-questions-about-linux). Az SCO leginkább a [Linux elleni perek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO_Group#SCO-Linux_lawsuits_and_controversies) miatt hírhedt, de 2000-ben még rendkívül jó barátságban álltak, bár az SCO nagyban nyomta a saját Unixát is mellette. További érdekességek: amikor még a 64-bit az Itaniumról szólt.\n\n[Douglas Adams](http://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/00/06/21/1217242/douglas-adams-answers-finally) és [Woz](http://apple.slashdot.org/story/00/01/07/1124211/interview-steve-wozniak-unbound).

Szegény MS-t azóta főleg az EU zaklatja, ezért van nekünk böngészőválasztó ablakunk is például, meg Windows Media Player nélküli N-es Windows.\n\n[L0pth](http://tech.slashdot.org/story/99/12/31/1030242/interview-the-l0pht-answers). Bevallom, nem hallottam róluk eddig semmit, leginkább, mert 2000-ben security startuppá alakultak, ahol megcsinálták a [L0pthCracket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L0phtCrack), majd 2004-ben felvásárolta őket a Symantec. Viszont, ők voltak az egyik első hackerspace, 1992-ben alakulva Bostonban. A legjobb kérdés az, hogy miket is használnak keresésre: természetesen Altavistát, NorthernLightot, Ask Jeeveset és végül a Yahoot.\n\n[KDE fejlesztők](http://tech.slashdot.org/story/99/11/26/1126252/interview-kde-developers-answer-your-questions). Ekkor még csak az 1.0-ánál tartottak, ahogy a GNOME is, és már akkor javában folyt a flame; a KDE 2 csak egy év múlva jön csak ki. Szó esik a Konquerorról, a beépített böngészőről, ami a [KHTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khtml) motort használta: ezt forkolja 2002-ben az Apple a Safarihoz, WebKit néven, amit használ többek között a Chrome is, meg egy tucat mobilböngésző, és úgy általában dominál jelenleg a második helyen az IE mögött.\n\nÉs hát van még több is, akit érdekel az összes, az [kattintson ide](http://interviews.slashdot.org/index2.pl?section=39\u0026color=green\u0026index=1\u0026view=stories\u0026duration=-1\u0026startdate=1999).

Ezek után követjük végig azt, hogy nő fel a két gyerek két teljesen különböző környezetben ([Sacramento, CA, USA](https://www.google.se/maps/preview/place/Sacramento,+Kalifornien/@37.7292672,-119.9237094,8z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x809ac672b28397f9:0x921f6aaa74197fdb), illetve [Fresvik, Norvégia](https://www.google.se/maps/preview/place/Fresvik/@60.6479978,8.8407623,7z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x463e015c70d219f1:0x6fdf8565f8bb1770)), valamint hogy veszik fel a kapcsolatot egymással, majd találkoznak újra hatévesen.\n\nZárójel, Norvégia egészen brutálisan szép, már így a képernyőn keresztül is, Muszáj lesz élőben megnézni.\n\nAzonfelül, hogy egy remek dokumentumfilm, említést érdemel a tény, hogy a fentebb kikövetkeztethető okokból a filmben felváltva beszélnek norvégul és angolul, mindez pedig svédül van feliratozva. Az angol része sima a dolognak, sőt, ott még helyenként figyelek, hogy az angolt hogy fordították svédre. De amikor norvégul beszélnek, és próbálok odafigyelni a szövegre, mert érdekel a norvég, valamint vannak erős hasonlóságai a svéddel, ésmindeközben a svéd feliratot olvasva legózom össze, hogy mit is mondanak, nos, ott kezd az agyam túlterhelődni. Ennek ellenére egyszer sem éreztem azt, hogy most nem tudnám, miről van szó a filmben, szóval azt hiszem, haladok.\n\n(Ha valakit érdekel, át tudom küldeni a filmet, sajnos csak a fenti \u0026#8212; norvég+angol hang, svéd felirat \u0026#8212; konstrukcióban.)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSaturday, 8 Feb 2014\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2014/02/08/a-nyelvtanulasrol-meg-egy-jo-dokumentumfilmrol-twin-sisters-tvillingsostrene-tvillingsystrar/\n\nMore about...\n\n* énblog:     https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9nblog/\n* film:       https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/film/\n* norvégia:   https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/norv%C3%A9gia/\n* svédország: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/sv%C3%A9dorsz%C3%A1g/"

Akkor döntöttem el, hogy oké, jó volt ez a mobilfotózós időszak, de kezdjünk el újra valami komolyon gondolkozni. Múlt hétvégén fotóztam is egy jót egy esküvőn egy kölcsönkapott Nikon D200-zzal meg egy 50mm f/1.4-ggyel, mindenközben pedig dilemmázgattam a Nikon D610 meg egy Canon 6D között, amit az döntött el, hogy pár napja a helyi használtpiacon feltűnt egy alig használt, féléves 6D váz, jelentősen olcsóbban, mintha újonnan vettem volna. Innen kicsit felgyorsultak a dolgok, de a lényeg az, hogy vasárnap délután óta boldog tulajdonosa vagyok a fentebb említett váznak és egy 40mm f/2.8 pancake objektívnek.\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_2365234\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/6d640.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/6d640.jpg\" alt=\"6D + 40mm pancake (photo by Dirk-Jan Kraan, dirkjankraan.com, original: http://www.flickr.com/photos/dirkjankraan/8003852611/ )\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2365234\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/6d640.jpg 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/6d640-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/6d640-624x416.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003e6D + 40mm pancake (photo by Dirk-Jan Kraan, dirkjankraan.com, original: \u003ca href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dirkjankraan/8003852611/\"\u003ehttp://www.flickr.com/photos/dirkjankraan/8003852611/\u003c/a\u003e )\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost mit mondjak?

Közben az egyik gyülekezetben megismert srác szintén lakást keresett, és mivel egyikünk se bánta, hogyha valakivel együtt kell élni, valamint mindkettőnknek hasonló irányba van munkahely, elhatároztuk keresünk valamit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSikerült is a múlt hét végén találni egyet, két hálószoba, nagyszoba, rendes konyha, fürdőszoba, kis erkény, remek környéken, és csak egy kicsit drágán.

A középtávú cél az, hogy össze tudjam állítani többé-kevésbé egy hétre előre, mit fogok enni.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnnek első lépéseként összeírtam legalább részben, hogy mik azok a dolgok, amiket és ahol enni szoktam, utána pedig ma elmentem egyrészt a piacra, másrészt a viszonylag közel lévő igen nagy szupermarketbe félig bevásárolni, félig további ötleteket gyűjteni.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA piac nagyon remek, bánom is kicsit, hogy nem jöttem el ide hamarabb, van benne minden, ami kell, hús, zöldség, gyümölcs, sajtok, pékség. Ebből az utóbbi kettőt vettem igénybe. Már hosszabb ideje vadásztam jobbfajta holland Gouda sajtra, úgyhogy amikor megláttam az egyik pultban, akkor nagyon megörültem, meg is kérdeztem, hogy milyen idős; mikor csalódásomat fejeztem ki fiatalságát illetően, akkor az eladó rutinosan rávágta, hogy de van ez a másik, a \u003ca href=\"http://www.juustukuningad.ee/index.php/en/news/40-purmer\"\u003ePurmer\u003c/a\u003e, ami szintén holland, és idősebb, tetszeni fog, próbáld ki.

A középtávú cél az, hogy össze tudjam állítani többé-kevésbé egy hétre előre, mit fogok enni.\n\nEnnek első lépéseként összeírtam legalább részben, hogy mik azok a dolgok, amiket és ahol enni szoktam, utána pedig ma elmentem egyrészt a piacra, másrészt a viszonylag közel lévő igen nagy szupermarketbe félig bevásárolni, félig további ötleteket gyűjteni.\n\nA piac nagyon remek, bánom is kicsit, hogy nem jöttem el ide hamarabb, van benne minden, ami kell, hús, zöldség, gyümölcs, sajtok, pékség. Ebből az utóbbi kettőt vettem igénybe. Már hosszabb ideje vadásztam jobbfajta holland Gouda sajtra, úgyhogy amikor megláttam az egyik pultban, akkor nagyon megörültem, meg is kérdeztem, hogy milyen idős; mikor csalódásomat fejeztem ki fiatalságát illetően, akkor az eladó rutinosan rávágta, hogy de van ez a másik, a [Purmer](http://www.juustukuningad.ee/index.php/en/news/40-purmer), ami szintén holland, és idősebb, tetszeni fog, próbáld ki.

Hanyagolom a továbbiakban. \n\nA legolcsóbb a 69 SEK-be kerülő ausztrál [The Black Shiraz](http://www.systembolaget.se/Sok-dryck/Dryck/?varuNr=6131) (2012) volt: igazából nincs benne semmi különleges, sokkal könnyebb mint a Gumfields Pinot Noirja, meg persze érezni is rajta, hogy majd\u0026#8217; feleannyiba kerül: ugyanakkor árkategóriájából maximálisan kihozza, amit lehet, nagyon kellemes, szerintem fogok még venni.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFriday, 9 Aug 2013\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/08/09/a-borokrol/\n\nMore about...\n\n* bor:        https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/bor/\n* énblog:     https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9nblog/\n* svédország: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/sv%C3%A9dorsz%C3%A1g/"

Ahogy ezt írom szombat reggel, már sokkal jobb a helyzet, nem volt olyan vészes a dolog.\n\n\u003cdiv id='gallery-12' class='gallery galleryid-2365054 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail'\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class='gallery-item'\u003e \n  \n  \u003cdiv class='gallery-icon portrait'\u003e\n    \u003ca href='/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-07-26-13.57.37.jpg'\u003e\u003cimg width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-07-26-13.57.37-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class='gallery-item'\u003e \n  \n  \u003cdiv class='gallery-icon portrait'\u003e\n    \u003ca href='/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-07-26-14.09.39.jpg'\u003e\u003cimg width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-07-26-14.09.39-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class='gallery-item'\u003e \n  \n  \u003cdiv class='gallery-icon portrait'\u003e\n    \u003ca href='/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-07-26-14.11.42.jpg'\u003e\u003cimg width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-07-26-14.11.42-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class='gallery-item'\u003e \n  \n  \u003cdiv class='gallery-icon landscape'\u003e\n    \u003ca href='/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-07-26-14.14.40.jpg'\u003e\u003cimg width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-07-26-14.14.40-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class='gallery-item'\u003e \n  \n  \u003cdiv class='gallery-icon landscape'\u003e\n    \u003ca href='/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-07-26-14.19.56.jpg'\u003e\u003cimg width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-07-26-14.19.56-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nAz úszás-punnyadás-úszás kombináció után délnek vettük az irányt, először szikláról sziklára ugrálva, amíg engedte a terep, majd az utolsó kilométert már rendes úton megtéve.

A dolgot [ebben a posztban](http://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/07/25/allapotjelentes-es-wallander/) vezettem fel.)_\n\nCsütörtök délelőtt megjött Bencze és Hanna, vettünk két 72 órás bérletet, leraktuk a cuccokat az albérletbe, és aztán visszamentünk a városba ebédelni. A Jensen\u0026#8217;sbe mentünk, olcsó és jó kaja, kicsit (nem kicsit) lassú cserébe, az ebédmenüs idejük alatt (11-16h) folyamatosan tele van. Nem rohantuk sehova, szóval nem volt gond, ebéd után még beneveztem őket az ottani all-you-can-eat fagyira, amikor kapsz egy kelyhet, és aztán tölthetsz bele ilyen McDonalds-szerű vaníliafagylatot és rakhatsz rá húszféle feltét. Akárhányszor.\n\nLett is délután négy óra, mire végeztünk, úgyhogy bementünk először a Systembolagetbe, egyrészt az élmény miatt, másrészt venni valami jobbfajta bort estére meginni. Az esti borozgatás előtt azonban bementünk még a belvárosban bóklászva a Trädgårdsföreningenbe (Horticultural society, kábé kertészeti társaság), ami a leírás szerint egy 19. századi park megőrive és ápolva, nagyon szép, van benne minden a zöldterületektől kezve a rózsakerteken át egy pálmaházig, mindenféle egzotikus növénnyel. Csináltam egy rakat képet, itt van alább egy pár.\n\n\u003cdiv id='gallery-11' class='gallery galleryid-2365045 gallery-columns-2 gallery-size-thumbnail'\u003e\n  \u003cfigure

A minap mondta egy kolléganő hogy lesz egy ingyen két hónap múlva, addig szerintem kihúzom.\n\nA lakás kicsit kisebb és kicsit kevésbé világos mint a régi (földszinti), ráadásul mindkét ablaka az udvarra néz, szóval kevésbé csendes, de egyik se kiemelten zavaró tényező. Határozott előrelépés, hogy a mosóépületben rögtön két szoba is van, ezért nincs túlterhelve a rendszer, és majdnem akkor mosok amikor akarok. Sőt! A mosógépek mellett szárítógépek is vannak. Ja, és van tévém is, csatornákkal, meg minden, olyan, mint az internet, csak kényelmetlenebb. \n\nAz egyetlen igazi panaszom az, hogy nincs vezetékes internet és egyhamar valószínű nem is lesz, emiatt kénytelen vagyok mobilnetezni, ami nem lenne gond, de egyelőre az egyetlen szolgáltatónak (a 3), ami értelmes adatmennyiséget ad (100 GB) feltöltőkártyás csomagban, nem túl jó az itteni térereje, épphogycsak eléri a már nem zavaróan lassú szintet. A megoldást még egyelőre keresem, vannak még opciók, bár hűséget nem írok alá elvből, lehet venni anélkül előfizetést, csak ahhoz vennem kell még az ebayről egy 4G modemet.\n\nAz új hely amúgy potom tíz percre van gyalog az irodától, speciel haza tudok járni minden nap ebédelni, ha nagyon akarok. Ha sikerül ezt kombinálni azzal, hogy meghívok kollégákat, akkor több motivációm lesz asszem a főzésre is.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMonday, 5 Aug 2013\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/08/05/az-uj-lakasrol/\n\nMore about...\n\n* énblog:     https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9nblog/\n* lakás:      https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/lak%C3%A1s/\n* svédország: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/sv%C3%A9dorsz%C3%A1g/"

Vagy annak, hogy szimplán angolul kommunikáljak. \n\nKöztes megoldásként azt találtam ki, hogy elkezdek nagyobb mennyiségben fogyasztani svéd filmeket meg sorozatokat. Oké, legyünk őszinték, túlzás ezt megoldásnak nevezni, olcsó kifogás inkább, de a semminél több, ha már amúgy is ezzel töltöm a szabadidőm egy fájdalmasan nagy részét, legalább vajmi előnye legyen. Feltettem hát a kérdést Facebookon, mit nézzek, kaptam is egy rakat javaslatot, közben magam is gyűjtöttem párat.\n\nAmi már megvolt: egyrészt az eredeti Millenium-trilógia \u0026#8212; ami valójában csak [egy film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132620/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2), mert a második-harmadik rész köztudottan nem történt meg \u0026#8211;, valamint láttam a [Show Me Love](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0150662/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)-ot is már, ami egyébként zseniális. Aztán pénteken belekezdtem egy [nagyon rossz romatikus komédiába](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2172061/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), kábé a feléig szenvedtem el magam, aztán kilőttem, volt még [egy másik](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2287715/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), azt méghamarabb. Az arányon javított, hogy szombaton megnéztem a [Kopps](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0339230/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)ot, amit jó filmnek semmiképp se mondanék, ellenben szórakoztató tud lenni.\n\nSorozatok tekintetében [megnéztem még márciusban](http://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/03/02/szombat-draft/) a [Lilyhammer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilyhammer)t, amit mondanám, hogy újra kéne nézni, mert kiváncsi vagyok, hogy ennyi hónap után hogy hangzik a fülemnek a norvég, de ismerem magamat, és nem vagyok az újranézős típus, szóval abból majd a második évad. Ja, szóval svédül kéne hallgatni dolgokat, ezt teljesítettem félig a [Bron (The Bridge)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge_(Danish/Swedish_TV_series)) című krimivel: félig svéd, félig dán. \n\nAz alapsztori az, hogy találnak egy félbevágott holttestet a svéd-dán határon, az [Öresund hídon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98resund_Bridge), ami Koppenhágát és Malmőt köti össze.

Megvan még a Kindle 1-em, amit szintén nagyrészt hanyagolok, amikor viszont olvasok, akkor azt általában az ájfónon teszem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eÚtközben vagyok, az esik kézre, van rá Kindle app — ami újabban kikapcsolhatatlanul kötőjelezi a könyveket, minden esetben angol szabályokkal –, Instapaper kliens, meg a \u003ca href=\"http://the-magazine.org/\"\u003eThe Magazine\u003c/a\u003e.

Sőt, nemrég áttértem éves előfizetésre, igazából véletlen, bénáztam a számlázási rendszerükben, de nem bánom, megéri a pénzét bőven.

Az utóbbi nyert végül a szavazáson, így azt játszottuk. Jó móka volt, de alapvetően frusztrál a Muchkinba, hogy mindegyik pontosan ugyanúgy szokott végezni, két vagy több játékos elérkezik az utolsóelőtti szintre, a legelsőt mindenki szétszivatja, nehogy megnyerje a játékot, és utána már senki kezében nincs semmi és a szerencse dönti el, ki nyer.

Az utóbbi nyert végül a szavazáson, így azt játszottuk. Jó móka volt, de alapvetően frusztrál a Muchkinba, hogy mindegyik pontosan ugyanúgy szokott végezni, két vagy több játékos elérkezik az utolsóelőtti szintre, a legelsőt mindenki szétszivatja, nehogy megnyerje a játékot, és utána már senki kezében nincs semmi és a szerencse dönti el, ki nyer.

Ezek után az ember berakja egy zsemleszerű tárgyba, applikál rá három kiló füstölt BBQ szószt és jóízűen megeszi. Először [Warren Ellis blogján](http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=14453) értesültem erről a kajáról, és bár egy-két kivételt leszámítva a sertéshúsért nem rajongok, annyira gusztusosan nézett ki a képen, hogy már akkor eldontöttem, ezt meg kell kóstolni. Aztán jó ideig elfeledkeztem róla, majd nemrég eszembe jutott, és ezzel majdnem egyidőben elmentünk múlt vasárnap a helyi [O\u0026#8217;Learys](http://www.olearys.se/Default.aspx?ArticleID=3226\u0026UnitID=5) sportbárba, amúgy Wibledon-döntőt nézni, de a tenisz sajnos végtelenül hidegen hagy. Voltak ellenben barátok, és jó kaja, név szerint egy pulled purkos hamburger, kaptam hát az alkalmon. Kicsit furcsa maga a formátum, mert addig oké, hogy buciba rakjuk, azt tényleg kell, de hogy még bacon meg sajt meg zöldségek, hát izé. A zöldségektől gyorsan megszabadítottam (azokat amúgy se szeretem*), a bacon meg a sajt azért maradt, és elkezdtem rá liberálisan adagolni a hely füstös-csípős BBQ szószát. Nem csalódtam: iszonyat finom volt az egész, biztos, hogy még vissza fogok járni ide, sajnos az árak már kicsit éttermiek.\n\n[\u003cimg src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/cb6e8ba4e88c11e287ee22000aeb0cc7_7.jpg\" alt=\"cb6e8ba4e88c11e287ee22000aeb0cc7_7\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2364911\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/cb6e8ba4e88c11e287ee22000aeb0cc7_7.jpg 612w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/07/cb6e8ba4e88c11e287ee22000aeb0cc7_7-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/07/cb6e8ba4e88c11e287ee22000aeb0cc7_7-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /\u003e](/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/cb6e8ba4e88c11e287ee22000aeb0cc7_7.jpg)\n\nA másik kedvenc hely tulajdonképpen nem igazán új, a [Da Marco](http://www.damarco.se/) az, amit már [korábban is](http://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/03/02/szombat-draft/) [emlegettem](http://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/02/12/munkaretreat-kedd/), itt lehet igen jó Bolognait enni. Vissza is járok egy-egy ebédre átlag 1-2 hetente. Tegnap amikor bementem, több embernél is láttam viszont Lasagnét, ami hihetetlenül jól nézett ki, és hát beschamel szósz ide vagy oda (laktózérzékeny vagyok), muszáj volt kipróbálni. Ismét nem csalódtam, életem talán egyik legjobb Lasagneját ettem meg, remekül eltalált tészta-szószok-sajt arány, jól átsütve. Ez ráadásul ebéd árba van, szóval igazából mostantól heti egyszer be kell iktatni.\n\n* asszem soha nem írtam le explicite itt, de iszonyat válogatós vagyok, többek közt hadilábon állok a zöldségek és a gyümölcsön túlnyomó többségével\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThursday, 11 Jul 2013\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/07/11/meg-tobb-kaja/\n\nMore about...\n\n* énblog:     https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9nblog/\n* svédország: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/sv%C3%A9dorsz%C3%A1g/"

Egészen mostanáig, amikor is elmentem a [Berså](http://www.bersagbg.se/burger-joint/) nevű helyre.\n\n[\u003cimg src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/6362c9e6d5b111e2a8c922000a1fc80c_7.jpg\" alt=\"6362c9e6d5b111e2a8c922000a1fc80c_7\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2364866\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/6362c9e6d5b111e2a8c922000a1fc80c_7.jpg 612w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/06/6362c9e6d5b111e2a8c922000a1fc80c_7-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/06/6362c9e6d5b111e2a8c922000a1fc80c_7-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /\u003e](/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/6362c9e6d5b111e2a8c922000a1fc80c_7.jpg)\n\nA fenti képet afféle emlékeztetőnek lőttem magamnak még, mikor megláttam, _Real American Burgers_, hírdeti, oké, próbáljuk meg, hátha, hátha. Aztán még azon a héten szombaton elmentem, és nem csalódtam. Rendeltem egy Chicago burgert, az volt a sajtos-baconős verzió, mindegyiket háromféle konstrukcióban lehet rendelni, szimpla-dupla-tripla, csak az a durva, hogy már az első is egy csinos, 200 grammos húspogácsával érkezik, és bár nagy az étvágyam, a dupla elég durván túlzás lett volna.\n\nAztán kihozta a pincérnő a dolgot, és nem csalódtam: a hús pontosan olyan, amilyennek lennie kell, ráolvasztva [Pepper Jack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_jack) sajt, esetleg a bacont lehetett volna megsütni jobban kicsit, de tényleg, nehéz kötekedni a dologgal, egyszerűen nagyon rendbe volt, ahogy a hozzáadott sültkrumpli meg coleslaw is. Ebéd közben amúgy helyenként élő zene ment, felejthető soft rock, de háttérzenének teljesen jó.\n\nAz árak is rendbe voltak: drágább, mint egy ebédlőhely (bár van 99 SEK-es ebédmenüjük, de ahhoz sajnos kiesik a hely), de az egészért fizettem olyan 220 SEK-et, itallal, borravalóval. Ja, és legközelebb lefotózom a hamburgert is.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWednesday, 26 Jun 2013\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/06/26/flashback-egy-jo-hamburger-goteborgban/\n\nMore about...\n\n* énblog:     https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9nblog/\n* kaja:       https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/kaja/\n* svédország: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/sv%C3%A9dorsz%C3%A1g/"

Ennek ellenére (vagy inkább emellett) is iszonyat drága minden, még így a svéd árakhoz szokva is, persze a norvég fizetéssel kicsit más a helyzet.

Nagyjából 9-re érkeztünk meg, kicseréltem, amit kell, majd megállapítottam, hogy ez műküdik, bár volt egy kis kitérő azzal, hogy miért tudom megölni a teljes irodában az internetet egy jól irányzott [speedtest](http://www.speedtest.net)tel: leginkább azért, mert DSL van, ami nem szereti annyira, mikor elkezdik komolyabban terhelni a feltöltést, valamint a sávszélt relatív szűkebben mérik az irodában (\u0026#8220;csak\u0026#8221; 24/4 MBit).\n\n12 előtt nem sokkal elmentünk ebédelni, ami arrafele szokatlan: mint kiderült, Norvégiában az a szokás, hogy ebédre hideg szendvics van (vagy ha nagy cégnél dolgozol, adnak ők), a meleg étel az este szokás, emiatt az éttermek árai is úgy vannak belőve, hogy oda az ember vacsorázni megy. Ennek ellenére (vagy inkább emellett) is iszonyat drága minden, még így a svéd árakhoz szokva is, persze a norvég fizetéssel kicsit más a helyzet. Érdekes volt még azt is megfigyelni, hogy egy csomó svéd szónak felismertem a norvég változatát, úgy tűnik, tényleg ragad rám valami a nyelvből.\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_2364819\" style=\"width: 612px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\n\n[\u003cimg src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/94c4f842d1c411e2b59422000a9f13f8_7.jpg\" alt=\"Kicsit furcsa volt így kenyérrel, ellenben a hús valamivel jobb volt a Svédországban ettek többségénél\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2364819\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/94c4f842d1c411e2b59422000a9f13f8_7.jpg 612w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/06/94c4f842d1c411e2b59422000a9f13f8_7-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/06/94c4f842d1c411e2b59422000a9f13f8_7-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /\u003e](/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/94c4f842d1c411e2b59422000a9f13f8_7.jpg)\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eKicsit furcsa volt így kenyérrel, ellenben a hús valamivel jobb volt a Svédországban ettek többségénél\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e \n\nNem sokat láttam a városból amúgy, leginkább mert kettőkor újra autóba ültünk, és visszaindultunk, mert különben elkaptuk volna a délutáni-esti csúcsforgalmat.

Ennek megfelelően aludtam legalább fél8-8ig, amikoris felkeltett a napfény. “Dehát már vannak sötétítőfüggönyeid!” — kiáltanak fel tapasztalt olvasók. Ez igaz is, azonban a harmadik emelet és a szép nagy ablakok kombinációjának megvan az az előnye, hogy az albérlet alapvetően nagyon világos — és nagyon fel tud melegedni. Emiatt már egy jóideje csak nyitott ablaknál lehet csak jól aludni, ami, hogy ne jöjjön a fejemre a hideg, a konyhában van nyitva, ahonnan meg kiválóan beszűrődik a fény reggelente.

Pont a döntőig bírtam ellenállni annak, hogy foglalkozzak az egésszel, úgy volt, hogy barátokkal együtt nézzük meg a döntőt, ez végül nekem különféle okokból elmaradt, otthon voltam, és a Doctor Who évadzárója után pont következett a BBC-n.

Magában a részben három ruhadarabot varrnak meg: egy alapdolgot minta alapján (“A” szoknya, ing, nadrág etc.), egyvalamit átalakítanak a saját kreativitásuk szerint, végül pedig jön a legnagyobb falat, amelyben egy komolyabb ruhadarabot kell modellre szabva elkészíteni.

Sikerült is később zavarba hoznom embereket olyan egyszerűnek tűnő, de valójában trükkös kérdésekkel, hogy például milyen kávét kérnek. (spoiler: méregerős hosszúkávé lett belőle, mert rosszul emlékeztem a receptre)\n\nAztán megjöttek az emberek, beszélgettünk egy kört, elmondtam egy gyors imát, elolvastuk azt a pár igeverserset, és lett ami lett: egy nagyon remek beszélgetés arról, hogy miért is kell hálát adni, hálát kell-e adni a rossz dolgokért, mik egyáltalán a rossz dolgok, közben mindenféle élettörténetek, és úgy egyáltalán, közelebb kerültünk egymáshoz is, meg Istenhez is, a végén imádkoztunk egymásért és a kéréseinkért, és egyszercsak azt vettük észre, hogy 9 óra. Szerintem nagyon jó lett, és a többiek is úgy tűnik, nagyon élvezték a dolgot.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSaturday, 27 Apr 2013\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/04/27/hazicsoport-nalam-szerda/\n\nMore about...\n\n* énblog:     https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9nblog/\n* svédország: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/sv%C3%A9dorsz%C3%A1g/"

A kollégák szerint van azért igazi és jó délszláv étterem a városban, mindenképpen le fogom tesztelni.\n\n[\u003cimg src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/279df624a69f11e2901022000a9e13ab_7.jpg\" alt=\"279df624a69f11e2901022000a9e13ab_7\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2364422\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/279df624a69f11e2901022000a9e13ab_7.jpg 612w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/04/279df624a69f11e2901022000a9e13ab_7-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/04/279df624a69f11e2901022000a9e13ab_7-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /\u003e](/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/279df624a69f11e2901022000a9e13ab_7.jpg)\n\nEste elmentem a helyi Ruby meetupra, a Got.rb-re, amit a Charmers egyetem startup-inkubátorában tartottak, és nem meglepő módon az egyik ott lévő startup szponzorálta. Egészen jó volt, tízperces előadások voltak mindenféle témákról, több dolgot el is raktam magamnak későbbre. A kicsi a világ jegyében természetesen egy magyar srác és egy felvidéki lány mögé ültem le, akikkel remekül elbeszélgettem az előadások után.\n\nHazafele annyira éhes voltam, hogy többedszerre követtem el azt a kardinális hibát, hogy hamburgert ettem ismeretlen helyen, ami sokadszorra és ismételten egy közel ehetetlen, a legrosszabb legalja pesti bódénál is rosszabb hússal jutalmazott, amit csak az előbb említett durva éhségem miatt nem dobtam ki azonnal. Mindenesetre mostmár tényleg megtanultam, hogy itt nem eszünk csakúgy ismeretlen helyen hamburgert többet, pláne nem a tizenkettő egy tucat kebabosbódékban.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThursday, 18 Apr 2013\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/04/18/megint-benne-vagyok-az-internetben-kedd/\n\nMore about...\n\n* énblog:     https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9nblog/\n* svédország: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/sv%C3%A9dorsz%C3%A1g/"

Pontosan akkor, mikor Ulrika közölte a napi meetingünkön, hogy szabadságra menne ezen és ezen és ezen a héten a nyáron, én meg csak néztem bután és magamban elmorzsoltam egy káromkodást, hogy ez nekem pontosan semmit se mondott, mi a dátum?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTermészetesen a dolog már sokkal korábban is feltűnt: a szupermarketek hetente bedobott papírjain is például mindig rajta van, hogy a benne lévő akciók melyik hétre vonatkoznak (pl. V15, az az eheti), sőt, egy ideje én is így rendezgetem a feladataimat. Mostmár mindenesetre nem tudtam tovább halogatni a dolgot, beállítottam minden létező használt naptárprogramban, amiben lehet, hogy mutassa a heteket.

Nézzük a jó pontokat: egy, gyakorlatilag ingyen van. Három napra kemény 10 korona, olcsóbb mint egy jegy a villamoson, meg van valami hosszabbtávú bérlet is. Ha egy út 30 percnél rövidebb volt, akkor ingyen van, utána 10 korona minden megkezdett félóra. A neten-telefonon lehet nézni éppen hol mennyi elérhető, és vannak olyan közel egymáshoz bőven a kölcsönzőpontok, hogy a 30 percből ne fussál ki. Innen már sejthető is a rendszer legnagyobb hibája: gyakorlatilag csak a belvárost és annak közvetlen környékét fedi le, ami egy nagyon kicsi terület, így az egész gyakorlati haszna erősen megkérdőjeleződik. Az én lakásomhoz legközelebb kb. másfél kilométerre van kölcsönző, ráadásul a munkahelyem pont a másik irányba van, szóval az nem opció, hogy esetleg egy ilyennel járjak munkába. Gyakorlatilag csak azoknak hasznos, akik vagy nagyon sokat mozognak a belvároson belül, vagy aki turistáskodni szeretne, mert arra tényleg kitűnő.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bd86fae09ead11e2ae2622000a1fb7e1_7.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bd86fae09ead11e2ae2622000a1fb7e1_7.jpg\" alt=\"bd86fae09ead11e2ae2622000a1fb7e1_7\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2364316\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bd86fae09ead11e2ae2622000a1fb7e1_7.jpg 612w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bd86fae09ead11e2ae2622000a1fb7e1_7-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bd86fae09ead11e2ae2622000a1fb7e1_7-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVégül megebédeltem a McDonaldsban, közben ránéztem az egyik szerverünkre, és ekkor tudatosodott bennem végképp, hogy nagyon mélyen él valamiért bennem az a cserkészmentalitás, miszerint \u003cem\u003ebe prepared\u003c/em\u003e (magyarul légy résen, de az angol kifejezőbb, szerintem).

Odaérve konstatáltam, hogy ez itt bizony népszerű esemény lehet, többszáz méteres sor állt a bejáratnál, de nagyon gyorsan haladt, nagyjából 15 perc alatt bejutottam. Teljesen elfogadható árú volt a dolog egyébként, 120 SEK volt a belépő, meg még 20 SEK a ruhatár. \n\n[\u003cimg src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/a456ac309e9611e2bd0222000a9e514f_7.jpg\" alt=\"a456ac309e9611e2bd0222000a9e514f_7\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2364310\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/a456ac309e9611e2bd0222000a9e514f_7.jpg 612w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/04/a456ac309e9611e2bd0222000a9e514f_7-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/04/a456ac309e9611e2bd0222000a9e514f_7-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /\u003e](/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/a456ac309e9611e2bd0222000a9e514f_7.jpg)\n\nNem tudtam, hogy pontosan mire számítsak, igazából, bár annak gyanúsnak kellett volna lennie, hogy a weboldalra posztolt nagyon rövid program abból állt, hogy melyik meghívott sztárral mikor lehet fotózkodni. Akikből egyébként egyébként sikerült egészen érdekeseket is meghívni: itt volt John Rhys-Davies, a doki a Slidersből (meg Gimli a LotR-ben), Christopher Judge (Teal\u0026#8217;c, Stargate SG1), Billy Dee Williams (Lando Calrissian), Jeremy Bulloch (Boba Fett) és Sam J. Jones (Flash Gordon, meg önmaga a Tedben). Erről a listáról messze a második volt a legérdekesebb, bár nála is csak odáig jutottam, hogy odamenjek, és csináljak egy képet, dedikálni nem volt mit, meg amúgy is idegenkedek általában az ilyesmitől.

Ezek után sokkal kevésbé lesz bűntudatom, amikor majd bevásárlok a ThinkGeeken, ami ide kicsit kevésbé pofátlan szállítási költséggel küld csomagokat, és ahonnan egy póló mindennel együtt ennek kicsivel több, mint a fele.\n\n[\u003cimg src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/f0ec86a49e9c11e2919b22000a9f1988_7.jpg\" alt=\"f0ec86a49e9c11e2919b22000a9f1988_7\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2364314\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/f0ec86a49e9c11e2919b22000a9f1988_7.jpg 612w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/04/f0ec86a49e9c11e2919b22000a9f1988_7-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/04/f0ec86a49e9c11e2919b22000a9f1988_7-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /\u003e](/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/f0ec86a49e9c11e2919b22000a9f1988_7.jpg)\n\nApropó, horgolt mario gomba. Meg nem tudom magyarázni miért, de mikor ezt először megláttam, azonnal elhangzott bennem az hogy ezt valami eszméletlen menő, és egy ilyen kell. Még nagyjából egy órát kűzdöttem a kisértéssel, megtéve még pár kört a sorok között, majd nem bírtam tovább, és megvettem a legnagyobbat, potom 200 koronáért. Az a szerencsém, hogy az eggyel kisebb ezután pár perccel elkelt, mert fél óra után már annak a vásárlására is éreztem erős késztetést. Hétfőn beviszem az irodába, jól fog mutatni az asztalomon, bár már több kolléganőm jelezte, hogy le akarja nyúlni.\n\n[\u003cimg src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ab0d132a9ea511e2905222000aaa031b_7.jpg\" alt=\"ab0d132a9ea511e2905222000aaa031b_7\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2364315\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ab0d132a9ea511e2905222000aaa031b_7.jpg 612w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ab0d132a9ea511e2905222000aaa031b_7-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ab0d132a9ea511e2905222000aaa031b_7-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /\u003e](/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ab0d132a9ea511e2905222000aaa031b_7.jpg)\n\nHazafele aztán úgy döntöttem, kipróbálom az itteni közbicikli rendszert, ami ötletből ötös, megvalósításból\u0026#8230; hármas alá. Nézzük a jó pontokat: egy, gyakorlatilag ingyen van. Három napra kemény 10 korona, olcsóbb mint egy jegy a villamoson, meg van valami hosszabbtávú bérlet is. Ha egy út 30 percnél rövidebb volt, akkor ingyen van, utána 10 korona minden megkezdett félóra. A neten-telefonon lehet nézni éppen hol mennyi elérhető, és vannak olyan közel egymáshoz bőven a kölcsönzőpontok, hogy a 30 percből ne fussál ki. Innen már sejthető is a rendszer legnagyobb hibája: gyakorlatilag csak a belvárost és annak közvetlen környékét fedi le, ami egy nagyon kicsi terület, így az egész gyakorlati haszna erősen megkérdőjeleződik. Az én lakásomhoz legközelebb kb. másfél kilométerre van kölcsönző, ráadásul a munkahelyem pont a másik irányba van, szóval az nem opció, hogy esetleg egy ilyennel járjak munkába. Gyakorlatilag csak azoknak hasznos, akik vagy nagyon sokat mozognak a belvároson belül, vagy aki turistáskodni szeretne, mert arra tényleg kitűnő.\n\n[\u003cimg src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bd86fae09ead11e2ae2622000a1fb7e1_7.jpg\" alt=\"bd86fae09ead11e2ae2622000a1fb7e1_7\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2364316\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bd86fae09ead11e2ae2622000a1fb7e1_7.jpg 612w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bd86fae09ead11e2ae2622000a1fb7e1_7-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bd86fae09ead11e2ae2622000a1fb7e1_7-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /\u003e](/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bd86fae09ead11e2ae2622000a1fb7e1_7.jpg)\n\nVégül megebédeltem a McDonaldsban, közben ránéztem az egyik szerverünkre, és ekkor tudatosodott bennem végképp, hogy nagyon mélyen él valamiért bennem az a cserkészmentalitás, miszerint _be prepared_ (magyarul légy résen, de az angol kifejezőbb, szerintem). Laptop nélkül szinte soha nem megyek sehova, és a táskámban mindig van tartalék kábel mindenhez (mini-microusb, ipod), meg az ájfóntok és hozzá a tartalékakksi, meg kézkrém meg USB-s töltő meg néha még egy digigép meg meg meg minden. Mert ki tudja, mikor jöhet jól.\n\nEste aztán beraktam az új Doctor Who részt, ami jobb volt, mint az előző és zárásképpen megnéztem utána a The Voice következő adását.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTuesday, 9 Apr 2013\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/04/09/szombat-indeed/\n\nMore about...\n\n* énblog:     https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9nblog/\n* svédország: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/sv%C3%A9dorsz%C3%A1g/"

Még arra is volt időm, hogy befejezzem a Cloud Sync Pokémont (_Gotta catch\u0026#8217;em all_), vagyis összegyűjtsem az összes ilyen szolgáltatást a gépemre:\n\n[\u003cimg src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/da.png\" alt=\"clouds\" width=\"263\" height=\"22\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2364292\" /\u003e](/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/da.png)\n  \nJobbról: Dropbox, Amazon Cloud Drive, Copy.com, Box.com, MS SkyDrive, SugarSync, Cubby, [Adium (csetkliens)], Google Drive. Csak azokat raktam fel, amik teljesítik azt a három kritériát hogy 1) limitek nélküli ingyenes tárhelyet adnak 2) van desktop sync 3) ez az alkalmazás amennyire lehet, natív. Ezzel sikerült számításaim szerint 59,2 GB ingyen tárhelyet összeharácsolni, bár ebben benne van 10,2 GB évek során kemény munkával szerzett Dropbox és 17 GB Copy.com. A dolognak amúgy értelme nem sok volt, egyszerűen kiváncsi voltam: a vége úgyis az lesz, hogy ha majd végképp elfogy a hely a Dropboxban, előfizetek rá, mert úgyis minden azt használja.\n\nEste aztán elmentem az egyik belvárosi Mac bolt boltba megveni az új töltőt, és egészen rendkívüli dologba futottam bele: egy olyan eladóba aki úgy volt kedves, rendes és veled beszélgetni akaró, hogy ez a legminimálisabb mértékben sem volt idegesítő vagy zavaró. Elcsevegtünk arról, hogyan nyírtam ki a töltőmet, megkérdezte, hogyan ejtük ki helyesen azt hogy \u0026#8220;utca\u0026#8221;, mert a barátnője félig magyar, és amúgyis észrevette hogy Magyarországtól kicsit délebbre meg azt mondják, hogy [ulica](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ulica). Az biztos, hogy ha legközelebb veszek valami Maces cuccot, ide fogok jönni.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSunday, 7 Apr 2013\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/04/07/csutortok-draft-2/\n\nMore about...\n\n* énblog:     https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9nblog/\n* svédország: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/sv%C3%A9dorsz%C3%A1g/"

Természetesen fotóztam, \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151319422350146.1073741825.722715145\u0026amp;type=1\u0026amp;l=06064c2b2e\"\u003eitt van pár kép\u003c/a\u003e a dologról.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElőtte azonban videóztam egy kicsit, illetve tesztnek indult az egész, aztán két remek felvétel lett belőle, legalábbis ha a hangot nézzük: teljesen tiszta, nulla torzítás, ha a másodikba nem énekelnék bele, akkor esetleg egy kicsit mégjobb lenne. A kép, nos. Mivel tesztnek indult, így csak leraktam az asztalra, következő vasárnap kicsit jobban fogok készülni.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAztán kellemesen elszocializálódtam az alkalom utáni fikán, olyannyira, hogy utána kb. annyira volt időm, hogy megebédeljek, és utána beüljek egy rövid órára a múltkor kollegina által mutatott kávézóba.

A tacokhoz megvolt minden szükséges kellék:\n\n[\u003cimg src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/413d1f9c989411e28dba22000a1f97e5_7.jpg\" alt=\"413d1f9c989411e28dba22000a1f97e5_7\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2364194\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/413d1f9c989411e28dba22000a1f97e5_7.jpg 612w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/413d1f9c989411e28dba22000a1f97e5_7-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/413d1f9c989411e28dba22000a1f97e5_7-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /\u003e](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/413d1f9c989411e28dba22000a1f97e5_7.jpg)\n\n(a képről hiányzik a lényeg, a tortilla meg a darált hús, de az is volt bőven, természetesen.)\n\nMost jártam először Götebörg agglomerációjában (vö. vidéken), a közlekedés teljesen jó arrafele, a vonat félóránként jár és 25 perc alatt odaért a vonatom a főpályaudvarról (plusz 10 perc séta az állomásról). A svéd kertvárosok, nos, úgy néznek ki mint a kertvárosok úgy általában, csomó faépítési ház, meg páremeletes tégla társasházak. Kicsit sivár így télen még a táj, de nyáron nagyon szép lehet.\n\n[\u003cimg src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/3a0dcb58989011e2ad1922000a1cbd31_7.jpg\" alt=\"3a0dcb58989011e2ad1922000a1cbd31_7\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2364195\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/3a0dcb58989011e2ad1922000a1cbd31_7.jpg 612w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/3a0dcb58989011e2ad1922000a1cbd31_7-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/3a0dcb58989011e2ad1922000a1cbd31_7-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /\u003e](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/3a0dcb58989011e2ad1922000a1cbd31_7.jpg)\n\nVacsorára tehát megettünk egy csomó tacot, megittunk egy üveg bort \u0026#8212; az előző nap a Systembolagetben vásárolt, véletlenszerüen kiválasztott 99 koronás (ez itt árban az alsó-középkategória) portugál bor egészen finom volt. Közben pedig beszélgettünk a cégről, a nyelvről, egymásról és a világ nagy dolgairól úgy általában, remekül elvoltunk. \n\n[\u003cimg src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/77891140989011e2850422000a1f9a85_7.jpg\" alt=\"77891140989011e2850422000a1f9a85_7\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2364196\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/77891140989011e2850422000a1f9a85_7.jpg 612w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/77891140989011e2850422000a1f9a85_7-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/77891140989011e2850422000a1f9a85_7-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /\u003e](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/77891140989011e2850422000a1f9a85_7.jpg)\n\nKaptam egy nagyon remek svéd nyelvtankönyvet ajándékba, valószínű ezt fogom bújni a jövőben, meg kölcsönvettem egy gyerekkönyvet, az olvasás gyakorlására, mert ugye ezeknek a legkönnyebb a nyelvezete.\n\nVisszafele a vonat felé későeste annyira belefeledkeztünk a beszélgetésbe, hogy sikerült pont lekésni a vonatot vissza a városba, az orrunk előtt ment el. Ulrika javaslatára beültünk kicsit melegedni az állomásnál lévő kocsmába-diszkóba, egészen mókás élmény volt, hozta az összes létező falusidiszkó klisét. Aztán megjött a vonatunk és sikerült még pont éjfél előtt nem sokkal hazaérni, hála annak is, hogy a Google adataival ellentétben nem kellett 25 percet várnom a villamosra, hanem valójában csak 7-et.\n\nKaptam ráadásul Ulrikától sötétítőfüggönyöket, illetve hát olyasmiket, azt mondta, eredetileg moziban használták őket. Otthon megpróbáltam felrakni az ablak előtt lévő karnisra, amit azonban nem terveztek ennyire nehéz függönyökre, és nem nagyon akarta a dolgot, úgyhogy miután az egész kóceráj leesett, elegem lett, fogtam magam, elővettem a fiókból a ducttapet, és szabályosan felragasztottam az éjszakára a függönyöket. Nem egy olyan megoldás, amit hosszútávon fent lehetne tartani, muszáj lesz szereznem új karnisokat, de a dolog működött, és ismét bebizonyosodott, hogy a ducttape a legjobb dolog a szeletelt kenyér óta, és minden háztartásba kell egy belőle.\n\n[\u003cimg src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-03-30-00.44.27-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"2013-03-30 00.44.27\" width=\"625\" height=\"468\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2364197\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-03-30-00.44.27-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-03-30-00.44.27-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-03-30-00.44.27-624x467.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" /\u003e](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-03-30-00.44.27.jpg)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSunday, 31 Mar 2013\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/03/31/vendegseg-nagypentek/\n\nMore about...\n\n* énblog:     https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9nblog/\n* svédország: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/sv%C3%A9dorsz%C3%A1g/"

Erősen valószínű tehát, hogy idén az ájfónnal fogok fotózni az esetek túlnyomó többségében, csak a frekvencia fog ingadozni kicsit.\n\nEz volt az elmélet és a duma, ma végigfotóztam a céges påsklunchot, majd felmentem a tetőre és csináltam ott is egy csomó képet (gyönyörű a kilátás) meg egy videót, de ezt majd egy másik posztban, hamarosan.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWednesday, 27 Mar 2013\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/03/27/az-fotozasrul/\n\nMore about...\n\n* fotózás: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/fot%C3%B3z%C3%A1s/\n* random:  https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/random/"

Háttérzenének szól az Irodavezető \u0026#8211; Kipakolom a Mosogatógépet c. szám:\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4a3WP7qX2MQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nVan új kedvenc pizzériám is, francia, konkrétan, [Cyrano](http://www.cyrano.se/) a neve, van jópár éttermük a városban, kettő a környéken is. Kedden a távolabbiba mentem Ulrikével, aminek megvan az előnye, hogy az út gyönyörű, a folyóparton és a kertvároson keresztül mész oda. Ma egy közelebbibe mentem, ahol pontosan ugyanolyan finom a pizza. \n\n[\u003cimg src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/8635584892e611e2ab6722000a9e087c_7.jpg\" alt=\"8635584892e611e2ab6722000a9e087c_7\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2364100\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/8635584892e611e2ab6722000a9e087c_7.jpg 612w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/8635584892e611e2ab6722000a9e087c_7-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/8635584892e611e2ab6722000a9e087c_7-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /\u003e](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/8635584892e611e2ab6722000a9e087c_7.jpg)\n\nElindult a céges szervezkedés a májusi [memoQfest](http://memofest.org/) nevű szakmai konferenciára, ahova a mai állás szerint hárman megyünk. Mint rezidens magyart, engem bíztak meg azzal, hogy szervezzem meg az egészet, már ma jelentős eredményeket értem el. Szállásunk van, mert egy kolléganőnknek magyar a férje, és emiatt van egy jó kis albérletjük újlipótban, ahova szoktak járni telelni-nyaralni. A repjegyek tekintetében úgy tűnik hármunknak három kombináció lesz mindenféle okok miatt, részemről azt kell eldöntenem, hogy a konferencia előtt jövök valamivel hamarabb, vagy utána maradok még valamennyit, ha már hazalátogatok. Van még a konferenciajegyek kérdése, de az is le lesz hamar tisztázva a jövőhéten.\n\nAz előbb lenyomtam egy menet Rosetta Stone-t (Unit 1, Lesson 3), megyek, berakom a vacsorára vásárolt instanttésztát a mikróba, és elindítok valami sorozatot, induljon hát a hétvége.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFriday, 22 Mar 2013\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/03/22/i-need-a-regex-and-i-have-heard-you-provide-the-best-shit-around-here-pentek/\n\nMore about...\n\n* énblog:     https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9nblog/\n* svédország: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/sv%C3%A9dorsz%C3%A1g/"

Aztán felültem a villamosra és elmentem a gyülekezeti palacsintaestére, ami előtt jól bevacsoráztam a sarki 7-11-ben, mert volt egy olyan sejtésem, hogy nem nagyon lesz olyan palacsinta, amiben nincs tej. Mindenesetre ittam a málnaszörpöket és megint jókat beszélgettem egy csomó emberekkel, a végére már meggyőztek, hogy én szervezzem meg a következő tollaslabdázós kiruccanásunkat, és hogy lehet, hogy újra meg kéne próbálnom gitározni. Anno tanultam öt év akusztikus gitárt plusz a szolfézs, amit akkor végtelenül gyűlöltem, mostmár utólag nem bánom bizonyos dolgokat, amiket ott tanultam. Valamint az egyik lánytól vasárnap kapok egy adag svédtanulós anyagot.\n\nA szombati projekt a helyi bolhapiacok feltérképezésének legalább elkezdése, a Google rögtön kidobott háromat, ebből jó eséllyel kettőt útba tudok ejteni, megyek is.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSaturday, 16 Mar 2013\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/03/16/pancake-night-pentek/\n\nMore about...\n\n* énblog:     https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9nblog/\n* svédország: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/sv%C3%A9dorsz%C3%A1g/"

Murphy törvénye szerint pedig ez egy olyan nap volt, amikor az átlagosnál többször szakítottak félbe valamivel, kizökkentve a programozásból. Mindezek ellenére végtelenül produktív voltam még így is, megírtam másfél programot, felfedeztem a C# 4.0-ban a dynamic keywordot, és azt, hogy számomra közel használhatatlan, valamint az automata named parametereket, ami igen menő, és már azt is tudom, mit kell tudni az IDisposable-ról. Mindenmellett végleg lekapcsoltam a két régi linux szerverünket, és elkezdtem dolgozni a belső regexp tréningen, első körben beszélve az illetékes kollégával, amit majd az követ, hogy írok hozzá egy részletes vázlatot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEste pedig összejött az előző posztban emlegetett várva várt találkozó az elődömmel. Nagyon gyorsan megtaláltuk a közös hangot, végigmentünk a kódok különböző részein, jegyzeteltem mindenféle random dolgokat, meg kaptam egy csomó tippet, hogyan tudok hatékonyabban belső programokat írni a jövőben, sőt, még az ASP.NET MVC alapjaiba is beavatott. Valamint találtunk random bugokat, amiket majd kijavítok előbb-utóbb.

Nem állítom, hogy megéri az igen borsos 600 dolláros árát, de nem szól olyan rosszul se, és jó, hogy nem kell egyelőre itthonra hangszórókra meg erősítőre beruházni, ami pláne nem lenne praktikus addig, amíg ki nem derül, maradok-e hat hónapnál tovább.\n\nMa megtudtam, miért nem népszerűbb errefele az online pizzarendelés, már a kulturális okok mellett, miszerint egyszerűen a [takeaway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeaway) terjedt el: lehetetlen egy személyre kaját rendelni a neten, mert a szállítók undorítóan magas minimális rendelési díjakkal dolgoznak, a legkevesebb, amivel találkoztam, 140 SEK volt. Szóval koradélután elmentem a lakástól pár villamosmegállóra lévő, [már bizonyított](http://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/02/12/munkaretreat-kedd/) [Da Marco](http://www.damarco.se/) pizzériába, és ebédeltem egy jót. Összehasonlításképpen: 130 SEK-et fizettem a tésztámért és egy nagy pohár kóláért, borravalóval, és ez már alsókategóriás étteremár. Az ebédmenüjük ugyanitt hétközben 69 SEK itallal együtt, ami egybevág bármilyen más helyi kajálda ebédmenüjével, el is kéne jönni pár kollégával ide a jövőhéten.\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_2363909\" style=\"width: 612px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\n\n[\u003cimg src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/b64aa0ae834811e29d6522000a9f134c_7.jpg\" alt=\"Ez ilyen svéd dolog, hogy a pizzériákban előételnek káposztasalátát esznek, nem először látom.

Nem tudom hova tenni.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e \n\nAz ebédelős (és utána bevásárlós) kiruccanást leszámítva ma itthon voltam, tovább játszottam az iOS fejlesztéssel, valamint elkezdtem nézni a [Lilyhammer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilyhammer) nevű sorozatot, amit Gazs ajánlott valamikor nemrég. A közhiedelemmel ellentétben nem a House of Cards, hanem ez volt a Netflix első saját gyártású (bár koprodukciós) sorozata, aminek az az alapsztorija, hogy egy maffiózó úgy dönt, feldobja az új főnököt, akit nem kedvel az FBI-nál, cserébe természetesen bekerül a tanúvédelmi programba. Ő azonban nem valamelik unalmas amerikai kisvárosban szeretne új identitást kapni, hanem Lillehammerben, Norvégiában, ahol az 1994-es téli olimpiát rendezték, és amit ő anno nagyon megkedvelt. Nem tudom igazából hova tenni a sorozatot, furcsa, nem a hagyományos sorozattrope-okat használja, viszont iszonyat szórakoztató.\n\nHolnap gyülekezet, és további pihenés.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSaturday, 2 Mar 2013\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/03/02/szombat-draft/\n\nMore about...\n\n* énblog:     https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9nblog/\n* svédország: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/sv%C3%A9dorsz%C3%A1g/"

Az történt, hogy tegnap elhagytam az aktuális darabot a kondiban, és hazafele vettem egy újat egy másik márkából, mert most kisérletezek az itt elérhetőekkel. Ma pedig a nap második felére szépen bepirosodott és felduzzadt a szemhéjam és a környéke, egyáltalán nem értettem a dolgot, a viszonylag gyenge allergiáim se így szoktak jelentkezni, csak este raktam össze a dolgot, hogy ez jó eséllyel az új szemcsepp miatt lesz, ezt leteszteljük amint szerezek csütörtökön egy olyan márkájút, amit ismerek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA munkában ma konkrétan \u003ca href=\"http://emaildetektiv.hu/2013/02/17/az-allandoan-kinyirt-rekord-esete/\"\u003eezt a bugot\u003c/a\u003e vadásztam több órán keresztül, sikertelenül, amíg be nem linkelte a blogposztot a twitteren \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/galffy/status/306739737497042945\"\u003egalffy\u003c/a\u003e, reméljük tényleg segít a mágikus újraindítás.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElkezdtem kicsit beletanulni az iOS fejlesztésbe is, ahol nagyon hamar belefutottam abba, hogy egyrészt nem lehet magán az eszközön tesztelni, amíg nem perkálja ki a kötelező 99 dollcsit az ember az Applenek (vagy Jailbreakel az ember), másrészt az iPhone Simulatorban bizonyos dolgok nem elérhetőek, például a Reminders, amihez pont fejlesztenék.

Az történt, hogy tegnap elhagytam az aktuális darabot a kondiban, és hazafele vettem egy újat egy másik márkából, mert most kisérletezek az itt elérhetőekkel. Ma pedig a nap második felére szépen bepirosodott és felduzzadt a szemhéjam és a környéke, egyáltalán nem értettem a dolgot, a viszonylag gyenge allergiáim se így szoktak jelentkezni, csak este raktam össze a dolgot, hogy ez jó eséllyel az új szemcsepp miatt lesz, ezt leteszteljük amint szerezek csütörtökön egy olyan márkájút, amit ismerek.\n\nA munkában ma konkrétan [ezt a bugot](http://emaildetektiv.hu/2013/02/17/az-allandoan-kinyirt-rekord-esete/) vadásztam több órán keresztül, sikertelenül, amíg be nem linkelte a blogposztot a twitteren [galffy](https://twitter.com/galffy/status/306739737497042945), reméljük tényleg segít a mágikus újraindítás. \n\nElkezdtem kicsit beletanulni az iOS fejlesztésbe is, ahol nagyon hamar belefutottam abba, hogy egyrészt nem lehet magán az eszközön tesztelni, amíg nem perkálja ki a kötelező 99 dollcsit az ember az Applenek (vagy Jailbreakel az ember), másrészt az iPhone Simulatorban bizonyos dolgok nem elérhetőek, például a Reminders, amihez pont fejlesztenék.

Emiatt nehéz megsaccolni, pontosan mennyit vesztettem az elmúlt hónapban, de jópárszáz koronát biztosan. És igen, az egészet megspórolhattam volna jórészt, ha nem lettem volna ennyire kényelmes, és készpénzezek a hónapban. Mindenesetre ennek holnaptól vége, legalábbis a napi vásárlásoknál.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDélelőtt elmentem gyülekezetbe és beszéltem az egyik oda járó csajjal, aki kifejezetten az EU-ból Svédországba költözőknek segít a napi munkája során. Megtudtam, hogy bár elméletben az EU-s TB kártyámmal el kéne, hogy lássanak mindenhol ingyen, a gyakorlatban a svédek szeretik ezt nem betartani, és nagyon ajánlott minden nem-sürgősségi orvosi dolog előtt megkérdezni, hogy ezért kell-e fizetnem. Ez mondjuk kicsit kellemetlen, még jó, hogy többhavi gyógyszerrel érkeztem ide mindenből.

Emiatt nehéz megsaccolni, pontosan mennyit vesztettem az elmúlt hónapban, de jópárszáz koronát biztosan. És igen, az egészet megspórolhattam volna jórészt, ha nem lettem volna ennyire kényelmes, és készpénzezek a hónapban. Mindenesetre ennek holnaptól vége, legalábbis a napi vásárlásoknál.\n\nDélelőtt elmentem gyülekezetbe és beszéltem az egyik oda járó csajjal, aki kifejezetten az EU-ból Svédországba költözőknek segít a napi munkája során. Megtudtam, hogy bár elméletben az EU-s TB kártyámmal el kéne, hogy lássanak mindenhol ingyen, a gyakorlatban a svédek szeretik ezt nem betartani, és nagyon ajánlott minden nem-sürgősségi orvosi dolog előtt megkérdezni, hogy ezért kell-e fizetnem. Ez mondjuk kicsit kellemetlen, még jó, hogy többhavi gyógyszerrel érkeztem ide mindenből. Terveztem itt elmenni egy-két hosszabb ideje húzódó nyavalyámmal szakdokikhoz, de ezt lehet, hogy potenciálisan\n  \nújra kell gondolnom.\n\nEttől függetlenül ezt a hat hónapos időszakot simán túlélem _personnummer_ és az azzal járó előnyök nélkül, de ha ennél tovább maradok, egészen biztosan kérni fogom, hogy vegyenek fel rendesbe, amihez jár adószám, meg minden.\n\nDélután találkoztam az emberemmel, hogy vegyek egy telefont. Ez utóbbi nem történt meg, mert valahogy valami nem klappolt az eladóval \u0026#8212; bár nem tűnt lopottnak a cucc, mégse tűnt százasnak az egész helyzet, úgyhogy úgy döntöttem, ezt most nem.

Telefont meg egyre inkább úgy érzem, hogy veszek újonnan, és vállalom az ezzel járó pluszköltségeket, cserébe sokkal biztosabbra megyek.\n\nTermészetesen amióta tudok tegnap óta a kultúrsokk dologról, azóta tartok kicsit attól, mikor fog beütni az egész lejtmenet. Főleg, mert előtte naívan úgy képzeltem, hogy megúsztam a dolgot, mert mikor anno huzamosabb ideig külföldön voltam, akkor rögtön brutális honvággyal kezdtem, ami nagyjából 2 hét után múlt el. Az más kérdés, hogy csak 16 éves voltam, tulajdonképpen félig-meddig nyaraltam, és csak két hónapra mentem. Szóval ez most egy kicsit (nagyon) más helyzet. \n\nMai napi _svédségünk_ pedig a [Fika](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fika_(coffee_break)): a helyi kávézási szertartás, az itteni _five o\u0026#8217;clock tea_, ahogy Gazs megjegyezte találóan cseten.

Amióta kondiba járok, azóta kezdek rászokni arra, hogy főzök magamnak / instant kajákat eszek, ha az előbbit tudom tartani, az mind anyagi, mind egyéb szempontokból remek lesz.\n\nEste konstatáltam, hogy elhagytam a frissen vásárolt szemcseppem. Reggel meglett a ház ajtaja elött, úgy tűnik, ott esett ki a zsebemből.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThursday, 21 Feb 2013\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/02/21/gyulekezetet-talaltam-szerda/\n\nMore about...\n\n* énblog:     https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9nblog/\n* svédország: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/sv%C3%A9dorsz%C3%A1g/"

Úgy döntöttem, vállalom a kb. dupla árat (783 SEK), és az [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/)-n szerzek szállást ahelyett, hogy egy 14 fős hostelszobában aludjak úgy-ahogy. Az első, fenti foglalási requestemet azonban szerencsémre visszautasította az ember azzal, hogy arra az időre már kiadta a helyet. Azért szerencsére, mert utána találtam a rendszerben ennek közel a feléért egy sokkal jobb dealt (452 SEK), amit most le is foglaltam.\n\n[\u003cimg src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/51036c0a75d111e2ad8422000a1fa8e9_7.jpg\" alt=\"51036c0a75d111e2ad8422000a1fa8e9_7\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2363723\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/51036c0a75d111e2ad8422000a1fa8e9_7.jpg 612w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/02/51036c0a75d111e2ad8422000a1fa8e9_7-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/02/51036c0a75d111e2ad8422000a1fa8e9_7-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /\u003e](/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/51036c0a75d111e2ad8422000a1fa8e9_7.jpg)\n\nA melóban ma megírtam az első programomat is a cégnek, fordítási memóriák jogosultságait piszkálja meg egy kicsit, holnap nekiesünk a következő, kicsit nagyobb falat feladatnak is.

A bank sajnos csak electron-kategóriájú kártyát hajlandó adni nekem, szóval a neten továbbra is a magyart kell majd használnom, apróhirdetések feladásához pedig majd segítséget kérek egy kollégától.\n\nItt egy hajó, átvezetőnek, meg egy kép arról, hogy felkerült a cég matrica formájában is a laptopomra.\n\n\u003cdiv id='gallery-6' class='gallery galleryid-2363695 gallery-columns-2 gallery-size-thumbnail'\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class='gallery-item'\u003e \n  \n  \u003cdiv class='gallery-icon landscape'\u003e\n    \u003ca href='https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/02/11/ottdolgozom-hetfo/1ec16a1c744111e2bee422000a9f14ea_7/'\u003e\u003cimg width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1ec16a1c744111e2bee422000a9f14ea_7-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1ec16a1c744111e2bee422000a9f14ea_7-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1ec16a1c744111e2bee422000a9f14ea_7-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1ec16a1c744111e2bee422000a9f14ea_7.jpg 612w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class='gallery-item'\u003e \n  \n  \u003cdiv class='gallery-icon landscape'\u003e\n    \u003ca href='https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/02/11/ottdolgozom-hetfo/7a8a80aa742711e2ada322000a1fbcdb_7/'\u003e\u003cimg width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/7a8a80aa742711e2ada322000a1fbcdb_7-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/7a8a80aa742711e2ada322000a1fbcdb_7-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/02/7a8a80aa742711e2ada322000a1fbcdb_7-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/02/7a8a80aa742711e2ada322000a1fbcdb_7.jpg 612w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nA munkában ma nem történt semmi különös, holnap megyünk a várva várt munkaretreat-napra, a Titkos Helyre, ami valószínű a főnököm nyaralója lesz, mint azt kollégák a kávé mellett tippelgették.

Jobb híján foglaltam jegyet a moziba az [Argó](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/argo_2012/)ra, és úgy döntöttem, addig majd bóklászok a városban. Már majdnem összeszedtem volna magam az induláshoz amikor megjelent a readeremben, hogy lesz [Barcamp Stockholm](http://barcampstockholm.com) márciusban, a [Thoughtbot](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/) szervezi és a [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com)nál lesz, ez két cég akiket amúgyis kedvelek, menjünk hát el, leglalább lesz alkalmunk megnézni a fővárost kicsit. Úgyhogy amellett, hogy lefoglaltam a jegyemet, megnéztem, mennyi a vonat oda-vissza (~650-750 SEK), két nap szállás (Hostel: ~400 SEK, AirBnB: ~900 SEK), meg a helyi közlekedés (72 órás kártya 230 SEK, de valószínű olcsóbb lesz sétálni és jegyet venni, mikor kell). Szóval március második hétvégéjén úgy tűnik, irány Stockholm.\n\nEzután tényleg elindultam, ezúttal gyalog, és útközben fotózgattam mindenfélét, többek közt egy jópofa óriáshőmérőt (lásd lejjebb), közbep pedig megebédeltem egy közepesen jót valamelik random gyorsétteremben.\n\n\u003cdiv id='gallery-5' class='gallery galleryid-2363659 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail'\u003e\n

A tanulságot levontuk, olyan kajákról is megkérdezzük, hogy van-e benne tej(szín), amikről eredetileg nem feltételezzük.\n\nHazafelé bevásároltam. _In my defense_, a sixpack kóla nagyon durván akciós volt, napi egyet iszok belőle a reggelihez, pont megvan a hónapra.\n\n[\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2363621\" alt=\"70ce1368714011e28b2322000a1fbe1b_7\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/70ce1368714011e28b2322000a1fbe1b_7.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/70ce1368714011e28b2322000a1fbe1b_7.jpg 612w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/02/70ce1368714011e28b2322000a1fbe1b_7-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/02/70ce1368714011e28b2322000a1fbe1b_7-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /\u003e](/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/70ce1368714011e28b2322000a1fbe1b_7.jpg)\n\nLassan ki kéne találnom, mit csinálok mosthétvégén, lesz például [demoparti a városban](http://www.datastorm.se/), amiről sajnos mind én, mind aki szólt nekem (azért köszi, [Martina](https://twitter.com/varsanyimartina)) későn értesült, szóval az kiesett, de kéne valami jobb program, minthogy itthon ülni a gép előtt. A nap felismerése egyébként az volt, hogy a Men Without Hats még létezik, illetve az énekes összerakott egy új csapatot 2010-ben, [mondja a wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_Without_Hats). Bő egy hét múlva fognak a városban koncertezni, de egy dal miatt nem fogok elmenni, azért berakom ide a poszt végébe, ne maradjatok ma se zene nélkül:\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0QDKLglEP5Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThursday, 7 Feb 2013\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/02/07/thursday-i-dont-care-about-you/\n\nMore about...\n\n* énblog:     https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9nblog/\n* svédország: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/sv%C3%A9dorsz%C3%A1g/"

A korábban emlegetett eszpresszógép rejtelmeit még erősen tanulgatom, reggel először egy teljesen ihatatlan kávét sikerült vele készíteni, és másodszorra is csak egy éppenhogy elfogadható valamit,

Alig egy hete vagyok itt, és egyrészt kábé egy hónapnak érződik: berendezkedtem, otthon érzem magam, megvan a napi rutinom, satöbbi, másrészt meg baszki, alig egy hete vagyok itt!\n\nValószínű a nagy váltás mellett betudható ez annak is, hogy gyökeresen megváltozott a napi rutinom, az utóbbi másfél évben a munka és a szabadidő teljesen összefolyt, nem vagy csak részben volt kialakult rutinom, a munkakezdés ideje sokszor összevissza volt. Ehhez képest itt felkelek 8-kor, beérek 9-re, 5-kor meg hazamegyek, és pont, vége a munkanapnak, tisztán szét vannak választva a dolgok, ami jó, azt hiszem, de ezt még nagyon szokni kell.\n\nSzóval megvolt a harmadik munkanap is, még pár hét és már nem fogom számolni hanyadiknál tartok, reszeltem tovább a linux szervert, frissítgettem dolgokat, megismertem hogy kezeli a Windows Server a DHCP-t meg a DNS-t, ilyesmik. A korábban emlegetett eszpresszógép rejtelmeit még erősen tanulgatom, reggel először egy teljesen ihatatlan kávét sikerült vele készíteni, és másodszorra is csak egy éppenhogy elfogadható valamit, messze vagyok még attól a minőségtől, amit a kollégák tudnak vele művelni. \n\nEbédelni ma nem a megszokott svédasztalosba mentem, mert az aznapi menü nagyon nem volt szimpatikus, szóval úgy gondoltam, itt az idő felderíteni kicsit a környéket kajaszempontból, elmentem egy [közelbe lévő ebédelőhelyre](http://www.rodasten.se/), ahol valamilyen halat ettem krumplival, egészen ijesztő szinten volt íztelen a dolog, nem akarom az első kaja után elitélni a helyet, de holnap megyünk tovább, van még pár kajálda a környéken, aztán majd valamikor később visszanézünk.\n\n[\u003cimg src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/9a95292e6f8911e28e0922000a9f1335_7.jpg\" alt=\"9a95292e6f8911e28e0922000a9f1335_7\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2363603\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/9a95292e6f8911e28e0922000a9f1335_7.jpg 612w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/02/9a95292e6f8911e28e0922000a9f1335_7-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/02/9a95292e6f8911e28e0922000a9f1335_7-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /\u003e](/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/9a95292e6f8911e28e0922000a9f1335_7.jpg)\n\nVisszafele fotózgattam egy kicsit az öbölben, sajnos utólag vettem észre, mennyire rondán rontja el az Instagram a képeket, pedig nem raktam rá semmi filtert csak a \u0026#8220;legyen szebb\u0026#8221;

Folytatva a pénteken elkezdett dolgokat, az egyik kezemmel frissítettem a felélesztett Mac Prót 10.6-ra, a másikkal pedig a készülő új linuxos webszervert kezdtem telepíteni. Az első szál gyorsan elhalt: a Snow Leopard még felment ugyan, de az updatek frissítésekor elszállt benne a másik gépből kukázott winchi, szóval ez a projekt most egyelőre parkolópályán, míg nem veszünk bele újat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA linuxos szerveren elképesztő mennyiséget összeszívtam rubys verziókezelőkkel, long story short, holnap felrakom a legújabb rubyt forrásból, mint az állatok, és kész, be akartam üzemelni a rendkívül hasznosnak látszó \u003ca href=\"http://gitlab.org/\"\u003eGitLab\u003c/a\u003eot, hogy ott tároljuk a jövőben a mindenféle céges kódokat, meghát úgyis lesznek majd rubys projektjeim, ismerem magam. Délelőtt még betekintést nyerhettem a céges szalagos backuprendszer rejtelmeibe és hibáiba, délután pedig megjöttek az első memoQ-os feladatok is, xliffet szereltem, kétszer is, az egyiknél valószínű bugra is futottam, ez majd kiderül, mindenesetre jó móka volt egy kicsit nyomozni.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemek időnk volt, amúgy, a nap egyik felében hóvihar volt, a másikban meg sütött a nap, az utóbbi időszakban ballagtunk el a céges eszpresszószekta egyik tagjával a törzshely kávéboltba, ahonnan több éve veszik a kávét.

Folytatva a pénteken elkezdett dolgokat, az egyik kezemmel frissítettem a felélesztett Mac Prót 10.6-ra, a másikkal pedig a készülő új linuxos webszervert kezdtem telepíteni. Az első szál gyorsan elhalt: a Snow Leopard még felment ugyan, de az updatek frissítésekor elszállt benne a másik gépből kukázott winchi, szóval ez a projekt most egyelőre parkolópályán, míg nem veszünk bele újat.\n\nA linuxos szerveren elképesztő mennyiséget összeszívtam rubys verziókezelőkkel, long story short, holnap felrakom a legújabb rubyt forrásból, mint az állatok, és kész, be akartam üzemelni a rendkívül hasznosnak látszó [GitLab](http://gitlab.org/)ot, hogy ott tároljuk a jövőben a mindenféle céges kódokat, meghát úgyis lesznek majd rubys projektjeim, ismerem magam. Délelőtt még betekintést nyerhettem a céges szalagos backuprendszer rejtelmeibe és hibáiba, délután pedig megjöttek az első memoQ-os feladatok is, xliffet szereltem, kétszer is, az egyiknél valószínű bugra is futottam, ez majd kiderül, mindenesetre jó móka volt egy kicsit nyomozni.\n\nRemek időnk volt, amúgy, a nap egyik felében hóvihar volt, a másikban meg sütött a nap, az utóbbi időszakban ballagtunk el a céges eszpresszószekta egyik tagjával a törzshely kávéboltba, ahonnan több éve veszik a kávét. Ennek megfelelően a tulajjal nagyon remek kapcsolatot ápolnak, a kávé mellett mindenféle jobbnál jobb bonbonokkal kínált minket, én egy 71%-os csokisat vittem, illetve kaptam egyet pluszba kóstolóba.

A cloudzenei szolgáltatásokkal eddig nem sokat törődtem, de az utóbbi pár hétben részben kényszerből átraktam a teljes zenemappám az archiválós külső winchimre, és a Deezerből hallgatok zenét. Nem éppen ideális, pláne hogy undorítóan sok dolog van geobanolva, lehet, hogy Spotify lesz ebből, annak van pl. asztali kliense. Vagy esetleg egy nagyobb SSD, ami így vagy úgy, de be fog figyelni mostmár, képtelenség egyszerűen 120 gigán elférni, a sebességből viszont nem adok, az SSD örökre elront.\n\nZárójel, nemtudományos tesztem alapján, amiben a iTunes top25 trackjeim elérhetőségét néztem meg a fent említett két szolgáltatásban, az jött ki, amire amúgy számítottam: a relatív populáris és relatív nyugati zene meglesz, a többi nem, szóval a 25 dalból 17-et talált meg, a maradék az japán, koreai, vagy bár amerikai, de kevésbé ismert zene volt. Szóval a lokális libraryt sehogy nem ússza meg az ember.\n\nMunkaügyben próbanapokon vagyok éppen az egyik helyen, és kedden repülök Svédországba megnézni mi is az a másik állás pontosan, sőt, közben befigyelt egy harmadik is, izgalmas lesz, mindenesetre jövő csütörtökön legkésőbb valószínű minden eldől.\n\n_The rules are the rules_, lejárt az időm.\n\nP.S. a szabályokat meg néha megszegjük, mert most jutott eszembe, hogy van a [Freebook Sifter](http://www.freebooksifter.com/) \u0026#8212; lelkes emberek fésülik végig naponta az Amazont ingyenkönyvekért kutatva, és nem, nem csak 200 éves klasszikusok vannak, hanem például a Scifi kategóriát megérdemelten vezeti a [Wool](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FC52L0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8\u0026tag=listfreebooks-20), ami egy zseniális posztapokaliptikus novellasorozat. Csak az első részt olvastam, zseniálisan van megírva, ugyanakkor nagyon nyomasztó, az elolvasása több óráig mély depresszióba taszított, alig bírtam magamat visszahozni az életigenlő szintre, ez egyébként engem is meglepett, ritka az ilyen. Szóval a maradék részek elolvasását már mellőztem. De akinek ez a csésze teája, az ne habozzon, mert tényleg bitangjó.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThursday, 10 Jan 2013\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2013/01/10/15-percem-van-utana-meg-kell-nyomnom-a-publish-gombot/\n\nMore about...\n\n* énblog: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9nblog/\n* random: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/random/\n* zene:   https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/zene/"

Az eredmény egyrészt a lentebb embedelt videóban található, másrészt az összes hozzá kapcsolódó link megtalálható [ebben a workflowyban](https://workflowy.com/shared/7b910ce0-a66a-d412-14c9-bcc7e4f9ecc2/).\n\nMindenesetre, előadni jó, és angolul előadni nekem mégjobb. Sokkal kevésbé voltam így lámpalázas a prezentáció alatt, nem tudom, lehet szimplán azért mert én nagyon szeretem angolul hallatni a hangomat és ez egy hatványozottan jó alkalom volt rá.\n\nCsak az előadás előtti egy hétnyi tömény stresszt, azt kell még kivédeni, de már vannak ötleteim legközelebbre.\n\nP.S. javasolt HD-ben nézni, arra optimalizáltam.\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/NwKjZPtH_h4\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTuesday, 16 Oct 2012\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2012/10/16/my-adventures-in-the-world-of-bookmarklets-meg-mindig-benne-vagyok-az-internetben-rovat/\n\nMore about...\n\n* bennevagyokazinternetben: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/bennevagyokazinternetben/"

Sajnos éppen kicsit meg vagyok rekedve, az Expertre még egyáltalán nem pályázok, de azt szeretném, hogy ezen a szinten le tudjak mindent játszani 90% felett gitárhős/rokkbanda játékban. Szóval most kemény munka és edzés.\n\n(Nagyon érdekesek amúgy a különbségek a különböző GH/RB játékok között, kezdve hogy mennyire megengedőek az algoritmusaik, vagy hogy hogy keverik a zenéket, vagy hogy hogy keverik a bogyókat a zenékre, vagy hogy\u0026#8230; na majd egy másik posztban, egyszer)\n\nMunkában zajlik az élet, egy jórésze tök jól megy, közben sikerült begyűjteni az utolsó pokélabdát a céges pozíciók gotta catch\u0026#8217;em alljában, azaz eddig voltam programozó, rendszergazda, language engineer, egyszer-kétszer fordító meg lektor, sokszor DTP-s, és egyszer régen pár napra voltam kicsit PM is, de most úgy igazából is PM is lettem, és egyelőre élvezem, persze még csak nagyon lájtos ez, de mégiscsak szintlépés.\n\n(Francba, nem, most jut eszembe, hogy pl. saleses még nem voltam. De nagyon szívesen várok annak a labdának a begyűjtésével, az nem az én világom.)\n\nEgy másik része meg kicsit kevésbé megy jól, mert még sohasem voltam hosszútávú, többhónapos szoftverprojektben, és így a második hónap után vannak nehézségek, ebbe keményen belejátszik az ADHD is mondjuk, de a helyzet javítása folyamatban van, épp ahelyett prokrasztinálok azzal, hogy blogolok, höhö.\n\nMostanában teljesen odaszoktam a Treffort Kertbe, jó az idő, jó a hely, szépek a lányok, van citromos sör, mi kell még? Áram, vágja közbe [Ádám](http://worldshots.hu/), az tényleg nincs, arra van most egy [HyperJuice](http://www.hypershop.com/)om ami persze hibásan érkezett, meg a hozzá tartozó [Apple MagSafe Airline Adapter](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB441Z/A) is, de jövőhétre minden ki lesz cserélve és akkor minden jó lesz.\n\nAz egészségem köszöni szépen, nincs túl jól, az emésztésemmel van valami baj, meg a lelkemmel sokkal több, de javulgatnak már, asszem, bár nem olyan gyorsan, mint azt én szeretném.\n\nOlvasni olvasgatok, bár az elmúlt két hétben kb tíz könyvbe kezdtem bele, és egy se fogott meg, de előtte elolvastam egy csomó dolgot, amire sajnos külön blogposzt kell amit tényleg meg fogok írni. Kondorvilmos és sok-sok Scalzi, ilyesmik.\n\nKerült egy céges iPad (sima 2-es, retinát sok szempontból nem is akartam) is, ami egyrészt tényleg hasznos a melóhoz, másrészt kicsit engem is megfogott most ez a post-pc dolog, jó lesz ez, csak kell neki még minimum 5 év és három új hardver meg iOS verzió.\n\nÉs az iPad miatt megint olvastam egy csomó képregényt, de azt majd a könyvesposztban.\n\n\u003cp\u003eZárjunk zenékkel, előszőr jöjjön a Helloweentől a Dr. Stein jazzesített verziója, mondom úgy, hogy az eredetit sose ismertem, de ezt átküldte Levente és jól rákattantam:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"601\" height=\"338\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/5yUihyOKxww\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValamint tegnap \u003ca href=\"http://sesam.hu/2012/06/21/grenade/\"\u003eSesam blogolt ki\u003c/a\u003e egy baromi jó \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR6iYWJxHqs\"\u003eGrenade\u003c/a\u003e-feldolgozást:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"601\" height=\"338\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/wMhL_QIyD1k\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFriday, 22 Jun 2012\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2012/06/22/random-dolgok-avagy-elet-es-enblog/\n\nMore about...\n\n* énblog: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9nblog/\n* zene:   https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/zene/"

Abban maradtunk, hogy mikor jövök a töltőért, akkor otthagyom majd a gépet, és megnézik, ha reggel viszem, lehet már délutánra bevizsgálják, és akkor elvihetem amíg meg nem jön a cserealkatrész.\n\nCsütörtökön reggel bementem, kaptam egy töltőt, adtam egy gépet. Aznap este türelmetlenül telefonáltam, hogy na, na, sikerült-e megállapítani a hibát, de azt mondták, hogy sajnos nem volt rá aznap idejük, de majd holnap délelőtt. Ma 12 előtt pár perccel jött az SMS, hogy elkészült a gép. Felhívtam őket, hogy akkor minden okés-e, megtalálták-e ők is a hibát, erre kiderült, hogy már kaptam is egy új trackpadet.\n\nMindenesetre most kicsit nyugaton érzem magam.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFriday, 2 Mar 2012\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2012/03/02/szolgaltatas-tortenik/"

Én pedig pár napja nekifogtam a dolognak, és mostanra került olyan állapotba, hogy vállalható legyen, szóval minden további időhúzás nélkül, kattintsatok: [sharewood.hu](http://sharewood.hu/)\n\nAz oldal olvasása mellett fel lehet iratkozni annak az [RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Sharewoodhu)-ére, ha valaki mindenki megosztását egy helyről szeretné olvasni, vagy letölthet egy [OPML](http://sharewood.hu/sharewood_opml.xml)-t amit aztán kedvenc RSS-olvasójába importálhat és kiválogatja, kiket szeretne olvasni.\n\nÉs ami a legfontosabb, ha csatlakozni akarsz hozzánk, [írj nekünk egy ímélt](mailto:join@sharewood.hu), és hozzáadunk. Ha hibát találsz az oldalban, vagy ötleted van, vagy akármi, [akkor is írj nekünk](mailto:info@sharewood.hu).\n\nA dolog technikai részletei:\n\nKezdtem az [eredeti Planet](http://planetplanet.org) szoftverrel, macera volt, kényelmetlen, de azt mondtam oké, ha megy, akkor legyen, elkezdtem összerakni a dolgot. Nagyjából akkor hajítottam ki az ablakon, mikor a képekkel kezdődő posztokat szimplán elrontotta.\n\nEkkor találtam rá a [Venus nevű forkjára](http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/), ami egy fokkal kevésbé volt bugos, és miután a [levelezőlistán elmondták](http://lists.planetplanet.org/archives/devel/2012-January/002248.html), hogy hol tudom kiszedni azt a fícsört, hogy az iframes embedeket kitépi a posztokból, már majdnem boldog voltam, de. A venus (és a planet is) szimplán legenerál egy statikus lapot az utolsó x elemből, és ennyi, se archívum, se több oldalra tördelés, se keresés, se semmi, szóval ezt kicsit kevésnek éreztem.\n\nA végén a planetrubyonrails.([com](http://planetrubyonrails.com)|[net](http://planetrubyonrails.net)) [motorjánál](https://github.com/anildigital/planet) kötöttem ki.

Ma reggel pedig bementem a [Soós](http://www.soosfoto.hu)ba, vettem hozzá obisapkát, sárga szűrőt, szíjat és 400-as Ilford filmet, szóval akkor \u003cdel\u003efotózásra fel\u003c/del\u003e dolgozzunk.\n\n(A [Contaxszal](blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2010/09/21/ki_gondolta_volna_9/) az történt, hogy a kedvenc objektívem valahogy leöntöttem valami ragacsos dologgal és ki kell tisztíttatni, valamint ezzel párhuzamosan a vázban a rekesz is úgy döntött, hogy beadja az unalmast, szóval komolyabb összeget kéne befektetni, hogy újra életképes legyen a rendszer. Ez valószínű meg fog egyszercsak történni, de addig is van mivel filmre fotózni.)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMonday, 23 Jan 2012\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2012/01/23/canonet-ql19/\n\nMore about...\n\n* énblog:  https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9nblog/\n* fotózás: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/fot%C3%B3z%C3%A1s/"

Aztán eltelt egy év, és kijött a Waters of Mars c. negyedik évadbeli special amit valamiért leszedtem (még egy esélyt megérdemelt), és egészen jó volt, és akkor már jött a nagy évadzáró End of Time, ami szintén nem volt rossz (annak ellenére h kb semmit se értettem belőle, naaagy évadzáró, ugye) így leszedtem utána a második évadot (az elsővel rossz emlékeim voltak, de azt is pótoltam később).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAz első, ami feltűnt, az, hogy igen, helyenként csúnyán gagyi de.

Ahogy haladtam előre a sorozatban, úgy lett egyre jobb számomra, és igen, egyfajta moffatista comingout ez, mert alapvetően sokkal jobban szeretem a (dark) fairytale ‘Whot, mint Davies ennél még sokkal sötétebb világát.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValószínű ezért is voltam akkora rajongója az 5. évadnak — a magamfajta moffatistának ez az eddigi legjobb –, főleg, hogy végleg felodotta bennem a sorozattal lévő, kicsit kognitív disszonanciás love-hate viszonyomat.

Egyetlen hátránya, hogy 150 ohmos, azaz hordozható lejátszó nem nagyon fogja tudni rendesen \u0026#8216;meghajtani\u0026#8217; \u0026#8212; ehhez már rendes hordozható erősítő kell (ezek egészen érdekes és zseniális szerkezetek amikről majdegyszer egy másik postban írok). Plusz nem olcsók, 160 dollárba fájnak jelenleg. \n\n**PK2** \n\n**[\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-644\" title=\"pk2\" src=\"http://ktamas.blog.hu/media/image/200907/pk2.jpg\" alt=\"pk2\" width=\"360\" height=\"315\" /\u003e](http://ktamas.blog.hu/media/image/200907/pk2.jpg)\n  \n** \n\nNo, ilyenem már volt, ez a középső típus. Egyrészt: tényleg úgy szól ez is, mint egy nagy fejhallgató. Ez elsőre egészen durva élmény, mert nem nézi ki belőlük az ember, persze olvastam, hogy ilyen jó, meg olyan jó, azért is vettem, de hogy _ennyire_, na az egy élmény. Kristálytiszta, gyönyörűen szóló közép- és magas, kíváló minőségű mély, amiből viszont sajnos a kelleténél egy kicsit kevésebb van talán az ideálisnál, szóval pl. basszustól csöpögő metál / rap hallgatásához nem ez az ideális füles, de a legtöbb zenei műfajhoz így is kiváló, plusz \u0026#8216;csak\u0026#8217; 80 dollcsi, és bármivel elmegy, mert csak 16 ohmos. Azt hozzátenném, hogy sajnos a kábele 10 hónap után kinyúlt \u0026#8212; igaz nem bántam vele kesztyűs kézzel. \n\n**PK3** \n\n**[\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-645\" title=\"pk3\" src=\"http://ktamas.blog.hu/media/image/200907/pk3.jpg\" alt=\"pk3\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\" /\u003e](http://ktamas.blog.hu/media/image/200907/pk3.jpg)\n  \n** \n\nJelenleg egy ilyet gyűrök, és azt kell hogy mondjam, ár-érték arányban messze a legjobb a csapatban. Továbbra is nagyon szép közép- és magas hangok, valamint meglepő módon majd\u0026#8217; PK2 minőségű, de annál valamivel nagyobb mennyiségű mélyek, ami miatt valamivel kiegyensúlyozottabb hangzásvilága is van. Nem szól olyan \u0026#8216;nagynak\u0026#8217; mint a PK2, de így is veri kb. az összes piacon lévő fülhallgatót, plusz az ára is nagyon barátságos, 40 dollcsi (+10 a szállítás hozzánk). \n\nÖsszességében: ha valakinek jó minőségű füles kell, tessék PK3-at venni, no, a [Head-Directnél](http://head-direct.com/) lehet. Megéri. \n\n(disclaimer: nem reklámpost, tényleg rajongok ezekért a fülesekért. A képeket szintén a Head-Directtől nyúltuk, remélem nem haragudnak meg majd érte.)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFriday, 3 Jul 2009\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2009/07/03/yuin/\n\nMore about...\n\n* füles: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/f%C3%BCles/\n* zene:  https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/zene/"

			"content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSzóval eljött az április, és eljött az Ubuntu 9.04 is, a próba kedvéért felraktam mind az asztali (munkahelyi) gépemre, mind a laptopomra. Az eredmények, nos, vegyesek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsztali gép: wifi nincs, viszont van videókártya (hehe), mégpedig ATi, abból is egy X300. A rendszer telepítés után nem hajlandó bekapcsolni a Compizt, a restricted drivers nem mutat semmit. Felrakom manuálisan a bináris drivert, halál, vesa módba kell kapcsolnom az X-et hogy újra életre keljen. Fél óra nyomozás után ellentmondásos információkat kapok, a legigéretesebbnek az tűnik, hogy ez a driver már nem támogatja az X300-at, csak azt nem sikerül megtudni, hogy akkor mi is. Itt jegyezném meg, hogy nem tudom, komolyan gondolták-e, hogy alapból kikapcsolva van a Ctrl+Alt+Backspace billkombó, de viccnek durva.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMindenesetre, fájdalmasan lemondva a Compizról, egy meglepően használható és gyors rendszert kapunk. A Gnomeon a legutóbbi verzió óta políroztak egyet, berakták az új notification rendszert, hármas openoffisz (az UI ikonjai határozottan rondák továbbra is), és sok egyéb apróságot. Belekerült a rendszerbe a screen-profiles is, ami a screen használatát könnyíti meg mindenféle előre elkészített scripttel (amit utána szabadon módosíthatunk).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKörülbelül egy hétig használhattam a rendszert, és meglepően megkedveltem. Sajnos azt a problémát továbbra se oldja meg, hogy bizonyos, a munkámhoz elengedhetetlen programok továbbra is csak windowson futnak (hello, Trados!), úgyhogy sajnos 1-2 naponta kellett valamiért elővenni valamelyik virtuális gépet a szerveren. Viszont, mikor egész nap pl. linux szervereket izélgettem, egyáltalán nem hiányzott a windows (és a putty). Még a narancsárga alaptémát is megszoktam pár nap alatt, sajnos a linuxos Skype mondjuk butus, a Pidgin pedig továbbra is néha minden szó nélkül elszáll. Viszont a Gnome Do továbbra is a nambervan segédprogram. De izé, szóval az egész rendszer határozottan jó irányba indult el, csak ne rontsák el a Gnome 3-mat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSajnos ekkor ütött be egy váratlan alaplapprobléma, úgyhogy kénytelen voltam 1-2 napig a laptopomat használni, amiben viszont van wifi (oh boy…) és Intel videokártya (jáááááááááj). Meglepő módon a wifivel nem nagyon volt gond — igaz kell neki reboot után úgy egy perc mire kapcsolódik, de ha az megvan, akkor megy –, a videokártya, na az viszont. \u003ca href=\"http://ktamas.blog.hu/2009/01/26/a_wind_es_az_ubuntu_esete_pt_1\"\u003eÍrtam már\u003c/a\u003e korábban a problémáról, de a legnagyobb egyelőre az, hogy laaaaaaaassssú. 2D-ben is. Két ablak között a váltás 1-2 másodperc, ami egyszerűen nevetséges.

			"content_text": "Szóval eljött az április, és eljött az Ubuntu 9.04 is, a próba kedvéért felraktam mind az asztali (munkahelyi) gépemre, mind a laptopomra. Az eredmények, nos, vegyesek. \n\nAsztali gép: wifi nincs, viszont van videókártya (hehe), mégpedig ATi, abból is egy X300. A rendszer telepítés után nem hajlandó bekapcsolni a Compizt, a restricted drivers nem mutat semmit. Felrakom manuálisan a bináris drivert, halál, vesa módba kell kapcsolnom az X-et hogy újra életre keljen. Fél óra nyomozás után ellentmondásos információkat kapok, a legigéretesebbnek az tűnik, hogy ez a driver már nem támogatja az X300-at, csak azt nem sikerül megtudni, hogy akkor mi is. Itt jegyezném meg, hogy nem tudom, komolyan gondolták-e, hogy alapból kikapcsolva van a Ctrl+Alt+Backspace billkombó, de viccnek durva. \n\nMindenesetre, fájdalmasan lemondva a Compizról, egy meglepően használható és gyors rendszert kapunk. A Gnomeon a legutóbbi verzió óta políroztak egyet, berakták az új notification rendszert, hármas openoffisz (az UI ikonjai határozottan rondák továbbra is), és sok egyéb apróságot. Belekerült a rendszerbe a screen-profiles is, ami a screen használatát könnyíti meg mindenféle előre elkészített scripttel (amit utána szabadon módosíthatunk). \n\nKörülbelül egy hétig használhattam a rendszert, és meglepően megkedveltem. Sajnos azt a problémát továbbra se oldja meg, hogy bizonyos, a munkámhoz elengedhetetlen programok továbbra is csak windowson futnak (hello, Trados!), úgyhogy sajnos 1-2 naponta kellett valamiért elővenni valamelyik virtuális gépet a szerveren. Viszont, mikor egész nap pl. linux szervereket izélgettem, egyáltalán nem hiányzott a windows (és a putty). Még a narancsárga alaptémát is megszoktam pár nap alatt, sajnos a linuxos Skype mondjuk butus, a Pidgin pedig továbbra is néha minden szó nélkül elszáll. Viszont a Gnome Do továbbra is a nambervan segédprogram. De izé, szóval az egész rendszer határozottan jó irányba indult el, csak ne rontsák el a Gnome 3-mat. \n\nSajnos ekkor ütött be egy váratlan alaplapprobléma, úgyhogy kénytelen voltam 1-2 napig a laptopomat használni, amiben viszont van wifi (oh boy\u0026#8230;) és Intel videokártya (jáááááááááj). Meglepő módon a wifivel nem nagyon volt gond \u0026#8212; igaz kell neki reboot után úgy egy perc mire kapcsolódik, de ha az megvan, akkor megy \u0026#8211;, a videokártya, na az viszont. [Írtam már](http://ktamas.blog.hu/2009/01/26/a_wind_es_az_ubuntu_esete_pt_1) korábban a problémáról, de a legnagyobb egyelőre az, hogy laaaaaaaassssú. 2D-ben is. Két ablak között a váltás 1-2 másodperc, ami egyszerűen nevetséges. Lehet downgradelni Intrepides driverekre, midnenféle módokkal kisérletezni (EXA, UXA, XAA, ABC, BFG, CBA etc.) de sehogy se tudtam emberi sebességre hozni, arról nem is beszélve h anno a compiz amúgyis érdekes glitcheket produkált. Úgyhogy fájdalmas búcsút vettünk egymástól, és rebootoltam vissza Windows 7-be. \n\nMindenesetre, ha helyreáll az asztali gép, nem kizárt, hogy tovább fogom használni, már amikor tudom, mert hosszútávon nincs értelme annak, ha az egyetlen nyitott ablak egy terminal services client valamelyik virtgépünkre\u0026#8230;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSaturday, 9 May 2009\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2009/05/09/hetyke_nyultilop/\n\nMore about...\n\n* linux:   https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/linux/\n* ubuntu:  https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/ubuntu/\n* windows: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/windows/"

			"content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSzóval az egész úgy kezdődött hogy elkezdtem dolgozni, és pár hónap után már mint társrendszergazdaként (is) tengettem az életem. Az akkori felállás egyszerű volt: 1 db szerver, rajta egy (már akkor kicsit outdated) Debian Sarge, Samba a fájloknak meg egy Apache a projektkezelőrendszernek. A hálózatos háttérről is fogok írni majd de az egy másik post lesz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzóval így kezdtünk, sajnos szegény szerver egy kis kondi nélküli szobában tengette az életét, amit bizony megsínylett, talán emiatt lehetett az, hogy az alaplap IDE, majd később a SATA vezérlője is erősen hisztis volt, és egy idő után egyre több nagyon gyanús hibát dobált.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzóval akkor alaplapcsere. Én akkor még elég kezdő voltam linuxban, de hallottam hogy az még az alaplapcserét is túléli (háháháhá). Winchi átrak, power gomb megnyom, kernel pánik. \u003ca href=\"http://mentalstatic.info/blogs/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLinuxos ismerős\u003c/a\u003e zaklatása, hát bizony a Sarge kernele nem nagyon ismeri a vadiúj alaplap ICH9R-jét.
