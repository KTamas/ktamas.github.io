Then, stealing a friend\u0026rsquo;s idea I simply put out a \u0026ldquo;Hey, I\u0026rsquo;m looking for a cool team to work with\u0026rdquo; message to social media and got a ton of different offers and I ended up with\u0026hellip; a cool team to work with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince February I have essentially a very well-paid half-time job at a small but important hosting company as a sysadmin. I\u0026rsquo;m a generalist at heart but out of all the things I do, working with servers is probably my favorite bit and I feel privileged to do that once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI also continued to work with a few other clients on some ongoing projects, and I ended this year sending out a huge quote \u0026ndash; one, if and if it works out, would keep me very busy in 2019, and that\u0026rsquo;d be great, so crossing fingers on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn a more personal note, I tried University this year and while I had some small victories, I pretty much dropped out already \u0026ndash; It\u0026rsquo;s really not for me. And I knew that but I thought the prospect of having a degree and therefore better chances at immigration to the US would be motivating enough, but it really isn\u0026rsquo;t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis year I also started drawing and it\u0026rsquo;s been fun! And I\u0026rsquo;ve also been to XOXO 2018, which was probably even better than 2016 and Portland already feels like a second home for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t plan to travel a lot this year and yet I count 10 (wow) different trips abroad, and most of these were for fun. I\u0026rsquo;ve been to Linz, Berlin, Gothenburg, Vienna, Amsterdam, San Francisco, Portland, Geneva, London.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t really know yet what 2019 will bring.
