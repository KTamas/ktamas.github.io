It\u0026rsquo;s got history: I set it up in early 2009, and I have almost 600 posts, mostly in Hungarian. I had one before that, between 2005 and 2008, but it was lost due to a variety of reasons, including my failure to properly back things up. Small bits of it are still \u003ca href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20070208165650/http://blog.ktamas.com/\"\u003eup in the Wayback Machine\u003c/a\u003e, though. It was all in Wordpress, which does its job, though even in 2019 it can be a pain to update things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"from-wordpress-to-jekyll-to-hugo\"\u003eFrom Wordpress to Jekyll to Hugo\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAbout a week ago I decided it was time to migrate it to \u003ca href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\"\u003eJekyll\u003c/a\u003e. I was bored, and it gave me a good excuse to play with a static site generator. Plus, doing this kind of conversion became a rite of passage for people working in tech these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is not a complete guide; you can find hundreds of them with a \u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+wordpress+to+jekyll\"\u003equick google\u003c/a\u003e. I will, however, provide a general overview of the process with some helpful pointers and links.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI started by migrating all the comments to Disqus with their \u003ca href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/disqus-comment-system/\"\u003eofficial Wordpress plugin\u003c/a\u003e. After that, I used a \u003ca href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jekyll-exporter/\"\u003eJekyll exporter plugin\u003c/a\u003e that converted all my posts into markdown\u0026hellip; except it stripped all the embeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI used to blog a lot about music, so I had a lot of embeds, mostly from Youtube. In retrospect, I could have saved myself some time by patching the exporter or finding another one. In the end, however, I ended up fixing every single post by hand. I replaced old, pre-iframe flash embed codes with updated ones and changed the newer, but still http ones to https. In most places, if the video was not necessary or wasn\u0026rsquo;t available anymore, I added the song to the post via Spotify. The chances of a given song being up on Spotify in a few years feels \u003cem\u003emarginally\u003c/em\u003e higher than on Youtube right now. I had a few other embeds that I could fix with newer code (Soundcloud) and others that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t (Deezer), but most of the time I could find the given song or playlist within Spotify. All of this had the benefit of walking down on memory lane, reading 10-year old blog posts and cringing a lot. \u003cem\u003eI was so young.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve found a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/vinitkumar/white-paper\"\u003ereasonably decent theme\u003c/a\u003e for Jekyll, which felt like a good starting point, though it didn\u0026rsquo;t have built-in support for tags or archives. I started googling how to implement that, and around the same time I was venting about my embed issues on the XOXO slack. That was when \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/theory\"\u003eDavid\u003c/a\u003e chimed in about his experiences on doing this exact same process, except he ended up using \u003ca href=\"https://gohugo.io\"\u003eHugo\u003c/a\u003e, another popular static site generator that\u0026rsquo;s kind of like Jekyll except faster. \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/theory/justatheory/tree/master/themes/justatheory\"\u003eThe theme\u003c/a\u003e of \u003ca href=\"https://justatheory.com\"\u003ehis blog\u003c/a\u003e had everything I wanted: a fancy archives page and proper support for tags. So I figured I might as well continue my journey: switch to Hugo and use his theme as a basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJekyll is written in Ruby and uses a simple templating language. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s code is in Go, and it uses Go\u0026rsquo;s own templates; they definitely have a learning curve, even if you have coded in Go before. With some help, googling and a lot of trial and error, I got the hang of it and managed to change things to my liking as well as the look and the color scheme of the site.

It also had OpenVPN installed so I could watch iPlayer for free until BBC started cracking down on that. By now it only had my blog and those static sites; I figured if I could find something for the latter, I could ditch the VPS entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t remember how, but I came across \u003ca href=\"https://netlify.com\"\u003eNetlify\u003c/a\u003e. They give you free static hosting with extremely generous soft limits (100 gigs of storage, 100 GB/month transfer).

I made backups of everything and then, somewhat emotionally pressed the \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo; button on Linode\u0026rsquo;s control panel. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if I would get another one eventually for a side project or something, but for now, I\u0026rsquo;m happy with my all my stuff hosted around the internet for free and stored in git repos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"on-the-future-of-my-blog\"\u003eOn the Future of My Blog\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMaking this move also means that I will start cross-posting my posts from \u003ca href=\"https://writetogether.space/users/ktamas\"\u003eWriteTogether\u003c/a\u003e to here.

But they say you just have to start and eventually something will come out of it, so that\u0026rsquo;s what I am doing now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThing is, \u003ca href=\"https://blog.ktamas.com/\"\u003eI have a blog\u003c/a\u003e, although I have not blogged regularly for years now. The only time I did that was in early 2013 when I moved to Sweden from Hungary. For a while I did post daily because things were new and exciting, but eventually it just became regular life stuff, and I slowly stopped; other things became priority. Nevertheless, it was an important period in my life, and I\u0026rsquo;m glad I have written memories of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAround 2013 I got myself a pocket-sized Moleskine, and I started writing down whatever came to my mind, journaling, more or less. I had that notebook with me religiously, in my right pocket, next to my wallet and in the next year and a half, I filled several of them. My favorite was the Evernote edition, which is not sold anymore. It gave you three months of Evernote premium but more importantly, it had nice, light, dot-grid pages which quickly became my favorite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI kept writing in my notebooks until the start of 2015 when I went digital and started writing all the things down in Evernote. Now, Evernote is by no means a perfect app: it\u0026rsquo;s bloated, slow and clumsy in many ways. And yet to this day, I have found no suitable replacement for it. It\u0026rsquo;s one of those softwares that my brain got hardwired to (like OSX, or Lightroom). Plus it\u0026rsquo;s available for every platform ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI usually make a note a day with the title being the current date. I make a lot of ad-hoc todo lists which is as close as I get to being organized with my todos, being tried at least a half dozen apps by now and never being able to stick to one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(I still carry a paper notebook with me everywhere, an A5 dotted Leuchtturm1917 Bullet Journal that I use for regular notebook purposes because BuJoing turned out to be Not My Thing™, but they make good notebooks. I mostly use it to take notes when I\u0026rsquo;m at my therapist.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last few weeks, I\u0026rsquo;m trying a new experiment with the todos, which is moving to a weekly format, so I have one Note with the todos for Week 51, one for Week 52 and so on. In each note, I have each day and a \u0026ldquo;Later\u0026rdquo; section, and I try to add as many things as possible because it gives me a sense of achievement and it\u0026rsquo;s nice to look back on days when I thought I got nothing done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eP.S. Thinking in weeks is a very Swedish thing to do. In Sweden, everyone knows what week it is, and they frequently refer to them as in \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m doing this on week X\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll be on vacation between week Y and Z.\u0026rdquo; If my memory serves me right, one of the most popular apps in the Swedish App Store for a long time was called \u0026ldquo;Week Calendar\u0026rdquo; until Apple added the option to display week numbers in Calendar. It drove me crazy for a long time, but I have to admit that it makes sense because it\u0026rsquo;s a good unit of time. I\u0026rsquo;ve been told the Germans do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis post originally appeared on \u003ca href=\"https://writetogether.space/posts/5/on-blogging-journaling-evernote-todos-and-thinking-in-weeks\"\u003eWriteTogether\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfooter\u003e\n    \u003ca title=\"Permanent link to “On Blogging, Journaling, Evernote, Todos and Thinking in Weeks”\" href=\"https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/01/03/on-blogging-journaling-evernote-todos-and-thinking-in-weeks/\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/a\u003e\n    By KTamas for \u003ca href=\"https://blog.ktamas.com/\"\u003eKTamas\u0026#39; blog\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003cdiv class=\"tags\"\u003e\n            \u003ch5\u003eMore about…\u003c/h5\u003e\n            \u003cul\u003e\n                \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/metablogging/\"\u003emetablogging\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n                \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/adhd/\"\u003eadhd\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n                \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/writetogether/\"\u003ewritetogether\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n            \u003c/ul\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/footer\u003e",
			"content_text": "Well, it's day 5 of my streak, and I have no idea what to write about. But they say you just have to start and eventually something will come out of it, so that's what I am doing now.\n\nThing is, [I have a blog](https://blog.ktamas.com/), although I have not blogged regularly for years now. The only time I did that was in early 2013 when I moved to Sweden from Hungary. For a while I did post daily because things were new and exciting, but eventually it just became regular life stuff, and I slowly stopped; other things became priority. Nevertheless, it was an important period in my life, and I'm glad I have written memories of it.\n\nAround 2013 I got myself a pocket-sized Moleskine, and I started writing down whatever came to my mind, journaling, more or less. I had that notebook with me religiously, in my right pocket, next to my wallet and in the next year and a half, I filled several of them. My favorite was the Evernote edition, which is not sold anymore. It gave you three months of Evernote premium but more importantly, it had nice, light, dot-grid pages which quickly became my favorite.\n\nI kept writing in my notebooks until the start of 2015 when I went digital and started writing all the things down in Evernote. Now, Evernote is by no means a perfect app: it's bloated, slow and clumsy in many ways. And yet to this day, I have found no suitable replacement for it. It's one of those softwares that my brain got hardwired to (like OSX, or Lightroom). Plus it's available for every platform ever.\n\nI usually make a note a day with the title being the current date. I make a lot of ad-hoc todo lists which is as close as I get to being organized with my todos, being tried at least a half dozen apps by now and never being able to stick to one.\n\n(I still carry a paper notebook with me everywhere, an A5 dotted Leuchtturm1917 Bullet Journal that I use for regular notebook purposes because BuJoing turned out to be Not My Thing™, but they make good notebooks. I mostly use it to take notes when I'm at my therapist.)\n\nIn the last few weeks, I'm trying a new experiment with the todos, which is moving to a weekly format, so I have one Note with the todos for Week 51, one for Week 52 and so on. In each note, I have each day and a \"Later\" section, and I try to add as many things as possible because it gives me a sense of achievement and it's nice to look back on days when I thought I got nothing done.\n\nP.S. Thinking in weeks is a very Swedish thing to do. In Sweden, everyone knows what week it is, and they frequently refer to them as in \"I'm doing this on week X\" or \"I'll be on vacation between week Y and Z.\" If my memory serves me right, one of the most popular apps in the Swedish App Store for a long time was called \"Week Calendar\" until Apple added the option to display week numbers in Calendar. It drove me crazy for a long time, but I have to admit that it makes sense because it's a good unit of time. I've been told the Germans do the same.\n\nThis post originally appeared on [WriteTogether](https://writetogether.space/posts/5/on-blogging-journaling-evernote-todos-and-thinking-in-weeks).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Thursday, 3 Jan 2019\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/01/03/on-blogging-journaling-evernote-todos-and-thinking-in-weeks/\n\nMore about...\n\n* metablogging:  https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/metablogging/\n* adhd:          https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/adhd/\n* writetogether: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/writetogether/"

			"content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI started 2018 with wanting to try Android after not using it for like five years; I had a Nexus S with Android 4 point something back in 2013 before jumping on to the iPhone bandwagon. So I got myself a cheap Moto G5 Plus just to play around with it, and to my surprise, I promptly fell in love with the whole thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAndroid has come a long way, and in many ways, it\u0026rsquo;s a better fit for me than iOS. I like the (relative) openness of it, the way it handles notifications, the ability to turn off animations (I hate UI animations with a passion), the customizability in general, better integration with Google and so on. The G5 Plus shipped with 7.0 Nougat, with the promise of an Oreo upgrade coming in late 2017, which arrived at the end of 2018 and made an otherwise fast phone somewhat slow. It ships with a vanilla version of Android, with a few enhancements from Motorola that are actually useful: a few gestures (for example, shake twice for flashlight) and a really good implementation of an active display (you can preview and even dismiss notifications from it very quickly). Oh and it had a great battery life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone did have one major flaw: the camera sucks.

			"content_text": "I started 2018 with wanting to try Android after not using it for like five years; I had a Nexus S with Android 4 point something back in 2013 before jumping on to the iPhone bandwagon. So I got myself a cheap Moto G5 Plus just to play around with it, and to my surprise, I promptly fell in love with the whole thing.\n\nAndroid has come a long way, and in many ways, it's a better fit for me than iOS. I like the (relative) openness of it, the way it handles notifications, the ability to turn off animations (I hate UI animations with a passion), the customizability in general, better integration with Google and so on. The G5 Plus shipped with 7.0 Nougat, with the promise of an Oreo upgrade coming in late 2017, which arrived at the end of 2018 and made an otherwise fast phone somewhat slow. It ships with a vanilla version of Android, with a few enhancements from Motorola that are actually useful: a few gestures (for example, shake twice for flashlight) and a really good implementation of an active display (you can preview and even dismiss notifications from it very quickly). Oh and it had a great battery life.\n\nThe phone did have one major flaw: the camera sucks. It's... passable at best, but even with the best daylight conditions, pictures simple look off at best, because of Motorola applying some extremely aggressive sharpening. Low-light performance? What low-light performance?\n\nSo I replaced it with a Pixel 2 which, at the time had the best camera on the market (it still is one of the best ones) and it was pretty great, except the GPS in it was pretty shitty, and I was used to using my phones for running. After it spending literally months in repair -- which is hard in a country where you can only buy grey market imports; mine is from Canada --, going back and forth and getting nowhere, I just got fed up with the whole thing and sold it.

Maybe next fall.\n\nThe X also has a good camera, and the optical 2x zoom should be mandatory on phones; its portrait mode is, in my experience, ever-so-slightly better than the Pixel 2's (its low light performance, on the other hand, is miles behind). I shot a [series of portraits with it on XOXO 2018](http://facesofxoxo2018.tumblr.com), and I was pretty satisfied with the results.\n\nI do miss Android, but I came to appreciate the big screen in a relatively small package -- I can still more or less use the X with one hand -- as well as the build quality. iOS 12 was a very welcome update as well with a few small things (faster animations! less waiting!).\n\nAnd there are certain things that, even in 2018 are just better in my experience on an iPhone; small things, like the smoothness of the touchscreen and the handle of touch in general, or having a working implementation of auto-brightness that not even the Pixel 2 can get right.\n\nOverall I am pretty happy with the X, and I will stick with it for the foreseeable future, even though I recently got myself a Pixel 2 again because I needed an ARCore-capable phone for AR game development.\n\nThe moral of the story is that I have disposable income and I was bored.
