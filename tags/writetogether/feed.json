But they say you just have to start and eventually something will come out of it, so that\u0026rsquo;s what I am doing now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThing is, \u003ca href=\"https://blog.ktamas.com/\"\u003eI have a blog\u003c/a\u003e, although I have not blogged regularly for years now. The only time I did that was in early 2013 when I moved to Sweden from Hungary. For a while I did post daily because things were new and exciting, but eventually it just became regular life stuff, and I slowly stopped; other things became priority. Nevertheless, it was an important period in my life, and I\u0026rsquo;m glad I have written memories of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAround 2013 I got myself a pocket-sized Moleskine, and I started writing down whatever came to my mind, journaling, more or less. I had that notebook with me religiously, in my right pocket, next to my wallet and in the next year and a half, I filled several of them. My favorite was the Evernote edition, which is not sold anymore. It gave you three months of Evernote premium but more importantly, it had nice, light, dot-grid pages which quickly became my favorite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI kept writing in my notebooks until the start of 2015 when I went digital and started writing all the things down in Evernote. Now, Evernote is by no means a perfect app: it\u0026rsquo;s bloated, slow and clumsy in many ways. And yet to this day, I have found no suitable replacement for it. It\u0026rsquo;s one of those softwares that my brain got hardwired to (like OSX, or Lightroom). Plus it\u0026rsquo;s available for every platform ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI usually make a note a day with the title being the current date. I make a lot of ad-hoc todo lists which is as close as I get to being organized with my todos, being tried at least a half dozen apps by now and never being able to stick to one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(I still carry a paper notebook with me everywhere, an A5 dotted Leuchtturm1917 Bullet Journal that I use for regular notebook purposes because BuJoing turned out to be Not My Thing™, but they make good notebooks. I mostly use it to take notes when I\u0026rsquo;m at my therapist.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last few weeks, I\u0026rsquo;m trying a new experiment with the todos, which is moving to a weekly format, so I have one Note with the todos for Week 51, one for Week 52 and so on. In each note, I have each day and a \u0026ldquo;Later\u0026rdquo; section, and I try to add as many things as possible because it gives me a sense of achievement and it\u0026rsquo;s nice to look back on days when I thought I got nothing done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eP.S. Thinking in weeks is a very Swedish thing to do. In Sweden, everyone knows what week it is, and they frequently refer to them as in \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m doing this on week X\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll be on vacation between week Y and Z.\u0026rdquo; If my memory serves me right, one of the most popular apps in the Swedish App Store for a long time was called \u0026ldquo;Week Calendar\u0026rdquo; until Apple added the option to display week numbers in Calendar. It drove me crazy for a long time, but I have to admit that it makes sense because it\u0026rsquo;s a good unit of time. I\u0026rsquo;ve been told the Germans do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis post originally appeared on \u003ca href=\"https://writetogether.space/posts/5/on-blogging-journaling-evernote-todos-and-thinking-in-weeks\"\u003eWriteTogether\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfooter\u003e\n    \u003ca title=\"Permanent link to “On Blogging, Journaling, Evernote, Todos and Thinking in Weeks”\" href=\"https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/01/03/on-blogging-journaling-evernote-todos-and-thinking-in-weeks/\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/a\u003e\n    By KTamas for \u003ca href=\"https://blog.ktamas.com/\"\u003eKTamas\u0026#39; blog\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003cdiv class=\"tags\"\u003e\n            \u003ch5\u003eMore about…\u003c/h5\u003e\n            \u003cul\u003e\n                \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/metablogging/\"\u003emetablogging\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n                \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/adhd/\"\u003eadhd\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n                \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/writetogether/\"\u003ewritetogether\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n            \u003c/ul\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/footer\u003e",

So I got myself a cheap Moto G5 Plus just to play around with it, and to my surprise, I promptly fell in love with the whole thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAndroid has come a long way, and in many ways, it\u0026rsquo;s a better fit for me than iOS. I like the (relative) openness of it, the way it handles notifications, the ability to turn off animations (I hate UI animations with a passion), the customizability in general, better integration with Google and so on. The G5 Plus shipped with 7.0 Nougat, with the promise of an Oreo upgrade coming in late 2017, which arrived at the end of 2018 and made an otherwise fast phone somewhat slow. It ships with a vanilla version of Android, with a few enhancements from Motorola that are actually useful: a few gestures (for example, shake twice for flashlight) and a really good implementation of an active display (you can preview and even dismiss notifications from it very quickly). Oh and it had a great battery life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone did have one major flaw: the camera sucks. It\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip; passable at best, but even with the best daylight conditions, pictures simple look off at best, because of Motorola applying some extremely aggressive sharpening. Low-light performance? What low-light performance?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo I replaced it with a Pixel 2 which, at the time had the best camera on the market (it still is one of the best ones) and it was pretty great, except the GPS in it was pretty shitty, and I was used to using my phones for running. After it spending literally months in repair \u0026ndash; which is hard in a country where you can only buy grey market imports; mine is from Canada \u0026ndash;, going back and forth and getting nowhere, I just got fed up with the whole thing and sold it. Only later I learned that many of the high-end phones lately come with shitty GPSes and if you wanna go running, you better buy yourself a running watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, I decided to jump back to iOS and got myself an iPhone X, about two months before the fall keynote. I figured I\u0026rsquo;d replace it with the new model when it comes out but the XS is a ridiculously incremental upgrade and I have no desire whatsoever to spend money upgrading. Maybe next fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe X also has a good camera, and the optical 2x zoom should be mandatory on phones; its portrait mode is, in my experience, ever-so-slightly better than the Pixel 2\u0026rsquo;s (its low light performance, on the other hand, is miles behind). I shot a \u003ca href=\"http://facesofxoxo2018.tumblr.com\"\u003eseries of portraits with it on XOXO 2018\u003c/a\u003e, and I was pretty satisfied with the results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI do miss Android, but I came to appreciate the big screen in a relatively small package \u0026ndash; I can still more or less use the X with one hand \u0026ndash; as well as the build quality. iOS 12 was a very welcome update as well with a few small things (faster animations! less waiting!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there are certain things that, even in 2018 are just better in my experience on an iPhone; small things, like the smoothness of the touchscreen and the handle of touch in general, or having a working implementation of auto-brightness that not even the Pixel 2 can get right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOverall I am pretty happy with the X, and I will stick with it for the foreseeable future, even though I recently got myself a Pixel 2 again because I needed an ARCore-capable phone for AR game development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe moral of the story is that I have disposable income and I was bored.

It has two-thirds of The IT Crowd and also Michelle Wolf, among others.\n\nOnwards to 2019!\n\nThis post originally appeared on [WriteTogether](https://writetogether.space/posts/5/my-recent-media-diet-on-the-last-days-of-2018).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Monday, 31 Dec 2018\nBy KTamas\nhttps://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2018/12/31/my-recent-media-diet-on-the-last-days-of-2018/\n\nMore about...\n\n* thoughts:      https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/thoughts/\n* mediadiet:     https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/mediadiet/\n* writetogether: https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/writetogether/"
