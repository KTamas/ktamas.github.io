Growing up fundamentalist, you learn that yoga (and most martial arts) are Bad. It’s by the devil; you’re worshiping other Gods, and so on. Even though I’ve been working hard to get rid of these parts of my faith, it’s a slow and arduous process.
So I never even thought of trying it for a long time.</summary>

<![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/02/14/on-excercise/">written about</a> my relationship with exercise, but I left out a significant bit: yoga.</p>

<p>Growing up fundamentalist, you learn that yoga (and most martial arts) are <em>Bad</em>. It&rsquo;s by the devil; you&rsquo;re worshiping other Gods, and so on. Even though I&rsquo;ve been working hard to get rid of these parts of my faith, it&rsquo;s a slow and arduous process.</p>

<p>So I never even thought of trying it for a long time. Then a former coworker and friend got into it; time to time she&rsquo;d say &ldquo;You should really give yoga a try,&rdquo; and I would be like yeah, maybe, someday. Putting aside old and harmful beliefs, it also looked just&hellip; boring.</p>

<hr />

<p>In late 2014 I broke my leg. Recovery was slow and painful, even though I did a decent amount of physical therapy. One day I stumbled upon a mass yoga event on Facebook and for whatever reason, I thought &ldquo;eh, okay, why not?&rdquo; So I went. It was awkward, unusual and weird, but I distinctly remember that afterwards the pain from my leg just disappeared for two days, like a miracle.</p>

<p>Even that was not enough at the time to start a regular practice, but in the spring of 2016, I finally pulled the trigger. I didn&rsquo;t even know how to breathe right on the first class (hint: use only your nose), but it felt amazing, especially after the class. So I kept going back, as much as I could, though I was traveling a lot during that time.</p>

<p>Yoga made me at least a bit more flexible, but more importantly, it helped me to slow down, and it gave me space to process things. My mind would often wander during class, and while that&rsquo;s somewhat discouraged, it was exactly what I needed at that time. And more often than not I would leave calmer and feeling more at peace with myself, something I desperately needed.</p>

<p>I was spoiled by having a great class filled with other expats and <a href="http://www.unfoldyourmat.com/">my awesome teacher, Lavinia</a>. For her regular drop-in classes I&rsquo;ve visited, she has her own style, a mix of existing ones, that has evolved over the recent years.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mVKUk8V.jpg" alt="Lavinia and I" />  </center>
<center>Me and my teacher</center></p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t done much yoga since I left Sweden. I&rsquo;ve searched and tried, but I haven&rsquo;t found a good class/teacher that I was happy with long-term—like I said, I was really spoiled, and it set the bar high. And maybe it&rsquo;s not what I need right now.</p>

<p>To this day though, whenever I visit Gothenburg, I make it a point to go to at least one of her classes, and they never fail to disappoint me. In an ideal world, I would be able to teleport to Sweden once a week for a 90-minute class.</p>

<p>I can only tell you what my friend kept telling me: you should really give yoga a try.</p>

<![CDATA[<h2 id="facts">Facts</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a few facts. I&rsquo;m fat. I&rsquo;m 174 (5&rsquo;7&rdquo;) and I weight about 125 kilos (275 pounds). I&rsquo;ve had high blood pressure for the last 15 years or so, though the causes of that are complex. My cholesterol is officially considered high as of a few months ago, and if I don&rsquo;t do something about it, I&rsquo;ll have to start taking meds for it.</p>

<p>A huge part of it is likely genetics; men on my father&rsquo;s side are historically overweight. But my terrible eating schedule (or the lack of thereof) and compulsive snacking does not help either.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go into my diet too much, because that&rsquo;s material for another post; in any case, it&rsquo;s a fact that exercise is something I definitely need.</p>

<h2 id="traumas">Traumas</h2>

<p>I have a messy relationship with working out and exercise in general. I was a chubby kid who was bullied growing up and I sucked at gym class. Having shitty teachers didn&rsquo;t help either. So what I quickly learned is to just give up. Had to run laps for a few minutes, and I&rsquo;m out of breath after 20 seconds? Just walk the rest of the way. The teacher will yell at you, classmates will make fun of you, but <em>whatever</em>. It&rsquo;s the least bad option.</p>

<p>In high school, I got lucky and got transferred to the special gym class, for kids with mild disabilities, motor issues and such. It was easier: only two classes a week, and one of them was swimming. Which I am not great at, but not the worst either. Even there, I mostly just gave up on things quickly, but there was a lot less bullying and judging going around.</p>

<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>

<p>After I was finished with school, I more or less stopped thinking of or worrying about exercise and didn&rsquo;t do much for almost ten years. There were times when I&rsquo;d go swimming for a couple times before I would get bored with it (I still do). There were short periods when I was biking instead of taking the public transport, but they never lasted. When I broke my leg in 2014, I did do a decent amount of physical therapy, but I half-assed even that somewhat. To this day, my right leg, the one that was broken is still a bit weaker. I would go to the gym irregularly after that, mostly doing 20-30 minutes on the elliptical machine. I kind of wanted to exercise, but a huge part of me was fighting against it mentally.</p>

<p>Then one day, about three years ago, while being stuck in a nasty loop of self-pity, a friend of mine miraculously got me to (somewhat) snap out of it by getting me to sign up for a military boot camp-style workout program. We made a deal: I would go 10 times, and I can stop after that if I wanted to.</p>

<p>I ended up going only six times, and I hated most of it, except for one part: running.</p>

<h2 id="running">Running</h2>

<p>One of the reasons I never considered running before was that it felt like the most boring thing ever; about as dull as swimming, if not more. That, and all the bad experiences in gym class growing up. But I had this strange urge to do it anyway.</p>

<p>When I started it was still very much winter, so I went to a sports store, got a bunch of warm running clothes, downloaded Runkeeper on my phone and then I just&hellip; ran.</p>

<p>I quickly realized that the only way I can do this is running intervals; that is, running a while, then walking a while, then running a while and so on. Runkeeper has a nifty feature where you can set up custom intervals; most of the time I tried to stick to 90 seconds of running and 60 seconds of walking.</p>

<p>I never had much of a running schedule. I would have phases; I would go for a run three times in one week, then skip the next two weeks. As I&rsquo;ve mentioned it earlier, it was a constant fight with myself. Part of me felt this urge to go for a run almost every day, but another part of me was actively fighting against it. I know this is a common experience; it&rsquo;s one that didn&rsquo;t really change over the years, though.</p>

<hr />

<p>Mostly eschewing &ldquo;real&rdquo; races, I was racing myself, trying to improve my pace. My dream was running a 5K in 30 minutes, which is a 6:00 pace average (the best I ever did was about 4K with 6:46 on a treadmill). I ran both outside and inside; each has pros and cons. Being outside gives you variety and makes things less boring; however, on a treadmill I can set a pace and push myself more.</p>

<p>I did find one race that I kept going back to called <a href="https://www.morfitrun.com/szigetrun">Sziget Run</a> a monthly timed 5K at Margaret&rsquo;s Island in Budapest, a popular running place. There is a bit of a community around it, and the organizers are great. It became this fixed thing in my life: once a month I would get up early, and do a 5K with a bunch of people. Most of the time I would finish dead last, but everyone was always a good sport about it, cheering me on.</p>

<p>One thing on my bucket list was doing a complete lap around Central Park, which I was fortunate enough to do when I went for a trip to NY in late 2016. It was literally one of the first things I did there. My pace was terrible, and I felt like I was dying towards the end but I did it, and I&rsquo;m still proud of it. The next day I would run an even longer distance around Williamsburg.</p>

<p>The longest run I did was last summer: it was a 12K race I signed up for. I first signed up for the 6K, then changed my mind in the last minute, thinking 6K is not much of a challenge, but I never did 12K, so why not? I finished last and my body was not happy with me afterwards, but I&rsquo;m glad I did it.</p>

<hr />

<p>I very seldom got what people call &ldquo;runner&rsquo;s high&rdquo;, but for a long time, I did feel much better after a good run. It was a challenge to get started, hell, it was a challenge to keep going but in the end, I would be rewarded with those sweet, sweet endorphins. Until I wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Around 2018 I was going through a time when I was pretty depressed, and running slowly started being less and less enjoyable. One could make the argument that exercise is not about enjoying it, but I digress; you need to get at least some form of satisfaction from it to keep going. And what kept happening was that I would go for a run, and come away feeling just as bad or even worse after it.</p>

<p>Last fall, when I was at XOXO 2018 I co-organized two morning runs that were quite popular. I&rsquo;m happy that I did that; at the same time, it was the last time I would go for a run, at least for a while.</p>

<h2 id="this-story-is-not-over">This story is not over</h2>

<p>I was going through some old diary entries late last year and I noticed a pattern: every 3 months or so, I would make myself a note: get a personal trainer. For years. So last month, after not doing any form of exercise since September or so, I did just that, with the goal of working out thrice a week.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only been 6 times so far, because I had to skip almost 2 weeks as I got sick, but so far, so good. We mostly do weights and some cardio, though yesterday we did a session with mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training">HIIT</a>. I have mixed feelings about it, we&rsquo;ll see how it works out in the long run.</p>

<p>My personal trainer and I talked about going running once the weather gets better, so who knows, I might pick it up again. For now, my goal is to do a solid hour of workout and hope that I feel at least somewhat better after. I&rsquo;m not there yet, but I don&rsquo;t hate it either, so the jury&rsquo;s still out.</p>

<p>In any case, I&rsquo;ll keep going.</p>
