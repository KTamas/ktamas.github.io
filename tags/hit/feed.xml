As I mentioned in the very first post, XOXO caught me at a particularly vulnerable and bad time, mental health-wise. Despite that, I had an overall amazing time at XOXO and for most of it, I managed to forget at least some of my worries and focus on spending time with all the amazing people in this community.</summary>

<p>As I mentioned in the very first post, XOXO caught me at a particularly vulnerable and bad time, mental health-wise. Despite that, I had an overall amazing time at XOXO and for most of it, I managed to forget at least some of my worries and focus on spending time with all the amazing people in this community.</p>

<p>I got to spend time with a lot of amazing people, have great conversations, heard a bunch of good conference talks, watched great performances at Story and so much more.</p>

<p>I got to work on a couple of projects which I thoroughly enjoyed and others did too — my portraits and the prints of them, the XOXO bingo and the XOXO calendar.</p>

<p>This was the third XOXO I&rsquo;ve been to and it was decidedly the best one. The festival gets refined every year, and it shows. There really isn&rsquo;t anything I can complain about except to suggest having more Karaoke next year.</p>

<p>I hope to be back — the lottery willing — in 2020 as well. The XOXO community means so much to me: it&rsquo;s an important part of my online, and for a small time of a year, offline social life, full of people I love spending time with (and they seem to like me too?)</p>

<p>XOXO gives me a special feeling: the feeling of &ldquo;finding my people&rdquo;. It just sucks that most of the people I want to hang out and spend time with live so far away.</p>

<hr />

<p>To close things up, here is a non-exhaustive list of people and things I&rsquo;m grateful for.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/fledglingnerd">Sarah</a>, thank you for telling me that &ldquo;XOXO doesn&rsquo;t start for me until I see you&rdquo;. I love you and you are the best XOXO mom and person I know. Thank you for the karaoke as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/joshmillard">Josh</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/angelapiller">Angela</a>, thank you for being my friends, I always enjoy hanging with you, and I wish we could do it more often.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/juliaskott">Julia</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/rileyjshaw">Riley</a>, it was fun working with you on the bingo, let&rsquo;s do it again next year.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/emorydunn">Emory</a>, it was fun traveling with you; I hope we get to do that again.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jonahedwards">Jonah</a>, it was great to finally meet, hang out and talk shop about infrastructure/sysadmin things, which I don&rsquo;t get to do very often.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bookymargoof">Becky</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/notjosh">Josh May</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gravitytrope">Eliza</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/juanbuis">Juan</a>, Crystal, Dan, <a href="https://twitter.com/lyyyndseyyy">Lyndsey</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/notdetails">Joel</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/stickwithjosh">Joshua Blunt</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/djbaskin">Danielle</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/li3n3">Liene</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/theearlcarlson">Earl</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hello_skyler">Skyler</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jwegener">Jonathan</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/dunjalazic">Dunja</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/fonorobert">Robert</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanw">Dylan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/spongefile">Tina</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/EssentialRandom">Vale</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/doug_hanke">Doug</a> and all the other people I got to hang out with, thank you for your company and often your kind words. They mean a lot to me.</p>

<p>And finally, <a href="https://twitter.com/andymcmillan">Andy</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/waxpancake">Andy</a>, Rachel, everyone else on the production team and all the volunteers, thank you for making XOXO an amazing experience for us.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>(Previously: <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/25/xoxo-2019-prologue/">Prologue</a>, <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/26/xoxo-2019-part-1/">Part 1 - Monday</a>, <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/27/xoxo-2019-part-2/">Part 2 - Tuesday</a>, <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/28/xoxo-2019-part-3/">Part 3 - Wednesday</a>, <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/29/xoxo-2019-part-4/">Part 4 - Thursday</a>, <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/30/xoxo-2019-part-5/">Part 5 - Friday</a>, <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/10/14/xoxo-2019-part-6/">Part 6 - Saturday</a>, <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/10/15/xoxo-2019-part-7/">Part 7 - Sunday</a>)</p>

<p>I woke up way too early, around 7:30 and checked the Slack as the previous night there were talks of having breakfast together with the people who were still in town. After returning the coats I got from Pendelton, I made my way to La Luna Cafe where we basically took over the whole place. I had some really great conversations with <a href="https://twitter.com/spongefile">Tina</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/li3n3">Liene</a> about America, exceptionalism and different perspectives. I got a great compliment from <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanw">Dylan</a>, as he turned to someone: “You don’t know Tamas? Tamas is like a hub [for people].” Liene also gave me a compliment: &ldquo;You’re an includer and I appreciate that.” All of this means a lot to me.</p>

<p>Afterward I got an invite to a lunch with a bunch of other people, which meant a lot to me (you know who you are.) I had a great time there as well, though anxiety started setting in again and the fact that XOXO is, in fact, over. I said goodbye to a few more people then went back to our Airbnb with Emory to check out. He was headed home, while my flight was the next day. I was staying at a kind XOXOer&rsquo;s place who offered to host me for a night back when my travel plans changed.</p>

<p>I dropped off my things, <a href="https://twitter.com/joshmillard">Josh</a> brought me a T-shirt that I ordered and arrived; we also said our goodbyes.</p>

<p>I took a bus to downtown, then scooted around to get a bunch of shopping done as well as return something to Amazon. I got a year&rsquo;s worth of Omega 3 capsules that cost me peanuts compared to what I pay in Hungary; a couple of tiny bottles of Tylenol and Advil because I love those tiny bottles (and they are useful). At one point I ran into <a href="https://twitter.com/dunjalazic">Dunja</a> downtown and made plans to get dinner later.</p>

<p>I went by Powell&rsquo;s to look for the kind of stickers Skyler gave me but unfortunately didn&rsquo;t find any; then I scooted to REI to get a bunch of water bottles and socks I needed.</p>

<p>I met up with Dunja, <a href="https://twitter.com/fonorobert">Robert</a> and Djordje at Sizzle Pie for dinner — they had decent slices but nothing special. We played with the Panic sign then said goodbye; I&rsquo;ll see Robert back home next week and Dunja is just a short flight away in Berlin.</p>

<p>I went back to the place I was staying at and then, XOXO was really over. I had a flight the next morning home, a trip almost 2 days long for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>To wrap things up, I have one more post, with a few closing thoughts and a bunch of #gratitude.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>(Previously: <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/25/xoxo-2019-prologue/">Prologue</a>, <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/26/xoxo-2019-part-1/">Part 1 - Monday</a>, <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/27/xoxo-2019-part-2/">Part 2 - Tuesday</a>, <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/28/xoxo-2019-part-3/">Part 3 - Wednesday</a>, <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/29/xoxo-2019-part-4/">Part 4 - Thursday</a>, <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/30/xoxo-2019-part-5/">Part 5 - Friday</a>, <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/10/14/xoxo-2019-part-6/">Part 6 - Saturday</a>)</p>

<p>After getting to bed so late, I decided to sleep in, so I set an alarm for 10:45 am. The last few days have been eventful, and I was started getting sad about it being the last day of XOXO.</p>

<p>I got to Rev Hall short after 11. I got Pip&rsquo;s for breakfast; I joined <a href="https://twitter.com/DunjaLazic">Dunja</a> and some of her friends who offered me a scone with a jam made from a local berry; I think it might have been marionberry. In any case, it was really tasty.</p>

<p>I caught <a href="https://twitter.com/thelindsayellis">Lindsay Ellis&rsquo;</a> talk, then went back to the park to hang out with <a href="https://twitter.com/djbaskin">Danielle</a> who makes the app <a href="https://dialup.com">Dialup</a>. It has groups (&ldquo;lines&rdquo;) you can join which have usually one call scheduled a week and it connects you with a random person in that group. I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the app and I was already part of the XOXO line; I had a good call with <a href="https://twitter.com/li3n3">Liene</a> a few weeks before the festival. I also ran into <a href="https://twitter.com/backlon">Dieter</a> (who writes for The Verge) and his wife <a href="https://twitter.com/Adora">Lisa</a> at the same time. We had a great conversation; Danielle also gave us one of her cool custom floppy business cards and talked about how she found random old data on them when buying them from eBay, stuff like someone&rsquo;s old thesis.</p>

<p>I ran into <a href="https://twitter.com/emorydunn">Emory</a> again who was sitting next to Jessica; she organized a really cool pre-xoxo party in 2018. We talked quite a bit about mental health and different medications.</p>

<p>And then it started pouring rain and we all ran back to Rev Hall. I gave Lyndsey back a couple of her things I was safekeeping from the day before; I also ran into <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanw">Dylan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/maxisnow">Max</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/fledglingnerd">Sarah</a> in the bar.</p>

<p>I went to Martha&rsquo;s to get my daily writing done, then had a really good chat with <a href="https://twitter.com/jonahedwards">Jonah</a> about all things infrastructure, trading all kinds of war stories and geeking out over the stuff I don&rsquo;t usually get to with people.</p>

<p>I went back to watch the last two talks; <a href="https://twitter.com/the_jennitaur">Jenny Odell&rsquo;s</a> was okay I guess — it didn&rsquo;t say anything new if you&rsquo;ve been following her — and also listened to <a href="https://twitter.com/RheaButcher">Rhea Butcher</a> doing standup which fell really flat for me.</p>

<p>The closing address was great as usual.</p>

<p>I went for dinner to a nearby pub with Sarah, Dylan, <a href="https://twitter.com/potentato">Tim</a> and someone else, but the place had literally nothing I could eat so I took a Lyft back to Rev Hall. I started saying goodbye to a few people, since I didn&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;d meet again at the closing party or the next day.</p>

<p>I had dinner in the Show Bar, went by the Karaoke place but they were still setting things up. I made the mistake of not getting my name on the list right then.</p>

<p>Back at the bar, I watched a bit of the interactive album debut of <a href="https://twitter.com/neilcic">Neil Cicierega</a> in which you could post things in a Slack channel and it would show up on the projector. It was pretty cool though I could barely hear any of the music.</p>

<p>The highlight of the day was, of course, the Karaoke by Baby Ketten: there were so many good performances, by <a href="https://twitter.com/Mike_Eagle">Open Mike Eagle</a>, Lindsay Ellis, <a href="https://twitter.com/electrolemon">Demi Adejuyigbe</a> and a lot more people I forget right now. <a href="https://twitter.com/notdetails">Joel</a> closed up the evening with Ghostbusters. I was on the list, but like a lot of other people, didn&rsquo;t get to sing, which kind of sucked; I was really set on doing karaoke at XOXO.</p>

<p>Not wanting the evening to end also wanting to do karaoke, a bunch of us went to Baby Ketten&rsquo;s newly opened bar with Sarah, <a href="https://twitter.com/jwithy">Jim</a> and someone else; the place slowly filled up with more XOXOers. I got to see <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks">Kevin</a> sing Common People; both Jim and Sarah sang Pet Shop Boys songs, while I ended up opting for — after changing my mind several times — Sweet Child of Mine, which was&hellip; a bit too ambitious in retrospect, but I did my best.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lVlFQTe.jpg" alt="karaoke" />
Let this blurry image be enough. I have a video of my full performance but I can&rsquo;t bring myself to watch it.</p>

<p>By then it was 1 am or so, and I was getting tired. I said goodbye to Sarah who told me a few more kind words and went back to my Airbnb. I was profoundly sad that XOXO was over; but as learned the next day, it really wasn&rsquo;t just yet.</p>

<p><em>(A postscript: a few days after a festival, someone posted on the slack about PSB&rsquo;s new album, and one thing led to another and now I&rsquo;m going to a PSB arena concert in London next May with a bunch of XOXO people.)</em></p>

<p>I woke up around 8:30 to a horrible nightmare, in which I was banned from XOXO because I tried to sneak someone I know in who&rsquo;s an asshole. On the way to Rev Hall, I took a duckface selfie for <a href="https://twitter.com/janklausa">Jan</a>, who couldn&rsquo;t come this year.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rEiWXdf.jpg" alt="selfie" /></p>

<p>I got to the venue around 9:30 and got breakfast once again at Fried Egg I&rsquo;m in Love. It felt like the first day of fall: instead of shorts and sandals, I wore jeans and my new shoe, that needed some breaking in.</p>

<p>I took quite a few portraits that morning, including this one of <a href="https://twitter.com/maxisnow">Max</a>, that&rsquo;s one of my
favorites:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XZza3HN.jpg" alt="max" /></p>

<p>I also ran into <a href="https://twitter.com/AviBagla">Avi</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DunjaLazic">Dunja</a>, Djordje and <a href="https://twitter.com/fonorobert">Robert</a> as well.</p>

Avi</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wYjktYE.jpg" alt="dunja" />
Dunja</p>

<p>I was about to get Pip&rsquo;s for dessert when I ran into a group of people giving away free Blue Star donuts; they were quite good.</p>

<p>I went to Martha&rsquo;s to get my usual morning coffee (a decaf iced latte) and to watch the simulcast of the conference; turns out it was only streamed to the other bar. I went over there but as it turns out, watching a talk and trying to write just doesn&rsquo;t work, so back to Martha&rsquo;s to finish the day&rsquo;s post.</p>

<p>I do want to make note of the emcees&rsquo; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the Andy&rdquo; joke, which was really funny.</p>

<p>Once I was done, I went back to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS1k88LzjkQ">Harry Brewis&rsquo; talk</a>, which was not bad, though I somehow expected more than just the recap of his famous livestream last year. I also caught the tail end of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHp_DwVm2EA">Emma Kinema&rsquo;s talk</a> about game industry unions before that.</p>

<p>After the morning talks, we took a group photo of all the bald people we could gather, organized by Elly:</p>

<p>In the lunch break, I took more portraits. I also met F6x and got to thank him for the help he gives us.</p>

<p>Around 2 pm, we did an encore of Tim Tam Slam Jam, showing more people this now-tradition. Afterwards I got to chat a bit with <a href="https://twitter.com/RottenInDenmark">Michael Hobbs</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Remember_Sarah">Sarah Marshall</a>, hosts of one of my favorite podcast, <a href="https://twitter.com/yourewrongabout">You&rsquo;re wrong about&hellip;</a> Michael also tried slamming and liked it a lot. I also took their picture.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I watched most of the talks: a couple of them were okay, the one that really stood out for me was by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW32yUEymvU">Hundred Rabbits</a>; they talked about sailing around the world and all the challenges that come with that.</p>

<p>After the conference ended, I headed to Martha&rsquo;s for a break where I ran into <a href="https://twitter.com/doug_hanke">Doug Hanke</a>. We talked like an hour about various life stuff and it was just a really great and meaningful conversation.</p>

<p>Before Story, I had a good chat with Elina Levkovskaya about fashion, and got to tell <a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewBogart">Matthew Bogart</a> that I love <a href="https://www.incredibledoom.com/">Incredible Doom</a> (I should finish reading it, now that the entire first volume is up online.)</p>

<p>I got a front seat for Story that started with You&rsquo;re Wrong About. They talked about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVIII_halftime_show_controversy">Janet Jackson Superbowl Halftime Controversy</a> and it was really great to see them live. This was followed by <a href="https://www.everythingisalive.com/">Everything is Alive</a> that interviewed a chainsaw; it was surprisingly entertaining. I took a small break to find my favorite tote bag that I managed to lose twice one day, then went back and caught most of  <a href="https://www.earwolf.com/show/yo-is-this-racist/">Yo, is this racist?</a>, where <a href="https://twitter.com/electrolemon">Demi</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/miel">Miel</a> were guests. They had some really touching questions from the audience in the end.</p>

<p>Next, <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenZaltzman">Helen Zaltzman</a> talked about pronouns in a live production of <a href="https://twitter.com/AllusionistShow">The Allusionist</a>. The final show that night was arguably the best one: the last episode of <a href="https://twitter.com/punchupthejam">Punch up the Jam</a> with Demi in it; they had <a href="https://twitter.com/neilcic">Neil Cicierega</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Mike_Eagle">Open Mike Eagle</a> for guests. The whole thing is up on Youtube and you should watch it; it&rsquo;s laugh-out-loud hilarious. I don&rsquo;t remember the last time I laughed that much listening to — well, watching — a podcast. They talked about the Ghostbusters theme song which turned into an in-joke for the rest of the conference. I even made a tribute page for it that lives at <a href="https://ghostbuste.rs/">ghostbuste.rs</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wFjBQhw.jpg" alt="r" /></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gI1db6y.jpg" alt="p" /></p>

<p>The day was not yet over; earlier that night I got invited to a house party by Juan, so that was my next stop. The party was great but loud and that&rsquo;s not my kind of thing so I ended up resting in a quieter room. <a href="https://twitter.com/jonahedwards">Jonah</a> ordered a bunch of pizza us; he also gave me another 90s temporary tattoo and I got two more for the future: one &ldquo;Under Construction&rdquo; and another that says &ldquo;Sign My Guestbook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was at that party I got to talk with <a href="https://twitter.com/EssentialRandom">Vale</a> — who&rsquo;s now a regular here at WriteTogether — about life, freelancing, 3D printing a fuck machine and she also showed her 3D-printed glow-in-the-dark Luigis on the cross with the Evangelion spear in their chest. I managed to get one of them in the form of a fridge magnet the next day.</p>

<p>I got home around 2:15 am and went to sleep around 3. It was also the first day that I wore my new sneakers, and they were not really comfortable; ultimately it turned out they are just not a good fit at all.</p>

<p>Friday was Social, which is probably my favorite day and the highlight of XOXO, with all the community-organized events.</p>

<p>I got to Rev Hall early so I got my daily writing done, then went to a cafe nearby for the off-the-books #ptsd channel meetup. I was on the fence about going but I&rsquo;m really glad I did; it was one of the best ones I&rsquo;ve attended. It was great to connect with other people there, learn about several interesting resources and share experiences. The place also had really good vegan chocolate chip cookies.</p>

<p>After the meetup, I went back to Rev Hall for the second half of my breakfast; I got a Yolko Ono from Fried Egg I&rsquo;m in Love. They were one of the highlights of XOXO 2016 and their breakfast sandwiches were almost as good as I remembered, which is to say, still pretty damn good.</p>

<p>By then it was time for the opening remarks, so I got a front-row seat in the Auditorium. The Andys were funny as usual, insert joke here about Andy Baio&rsquo;s bathroom.</p>

<p>The Tim Tam Slam Jam kicked off the Social meetups for me, for which a sizable crowd had formed, one that was much bigger than 2018. I sort of assumed that quite a few people would bring Tim Tams and felt like the 12 boxes I got a few weeks before were overkill. That wasn&rsquo;t the case; we only had a few more boxes on top of it. Someone said they were hard to come by in Portland.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aaufyGG.jpg" alt="timtams" /></p>

<p>And so we slammed and it was heaps of fun as usual; people keep saying that the caramel one is not that good for slamming but I disagree, they are my favorites.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/cOpVuuT.jpg" alt="slammin" /></p>

<p>Having gotten my sugar fix, I hung out with <a href="https://twitter.com/hello_skyler">Skyler</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jwegener">Jonathan</a>,  Inness and <a href="https://twitter.com/megansaxelby">Megan</a>. We had a good conversation, Megan gave us her zine about not freaking out, and Jonathan showed off his interactive two-person story thing that uses Airpods. I got to try it last year at XOXO 2018 and was excited about the progress he made; the demo he showed was pretty fun.</p>

<p>I walked to the #visual-art meetup with Jonathan and Inness. On the way there, Jonathan talked about living in Venice Beach and all the scooters there.</p>

<p>The meetup was nice, in a small art gallery, with a lot of people drawing. There was also a lot of cool art on exhibition. I took a few portraits there, including one of <a href="https://twitter.com/degreyish">Eler</a> that turned out particularly well. I ran into <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks">Kevin</a> there and bought an XOXO mug from Julia.</p>

<p>Next, I went to Glitch&rsquo;s Appy Hour. I ran into Lyndsey there again as well as a few other friends. I watched <a href="https://twitter.com/nicolehe">Nicole He</a>&rsquo;s cool demo for her upcoming interactive project and a Powerpoint Karaoke that was fun. I got to talk with one of my Internet Heroes, <a href="https://twitter.com/jkottke">Jason Kottke</a>; we had a good chat. He told me to email him the link to my portraits after the festival, if I somehow end up on <a href="https://kottke.org">kottke.org</a> I can die happy (so far it hasn&rsquo;t happened.)</p>

<p>I took a scooter back to Rev Hall to check out <a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a>, Panic&rsquo;s upcoming quirky game console. They only had one game you could play it, and it&rsquo;s a cool device but a lot will depend on the games people will develop for it. I finally got to meet <a href="https://twitter.com/meyer">Mike</a> and got to know <a href="https://twitter.com/vladgeorgescu">Vlad</a>; I obviously took their portraits as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2SieyXG.jpg" alt="mike" />
Mike</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/v7CCwbl.jpg" alt="vlad" />
Vlad</p>

<p>I ran into Skyler again and she told me about <a href="https://twitter.com/theearlcarlson">Earl</a>&rsquo;s concert at 4 at #music-making so after hanging out a bit in the park, that was my next stop. We watched him do some chill electro music (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/kiatremusic/release_ep">he has a soundcloud</a>), it was pretty great and a good way to take a break from this marathon of a day. By then it was around 4:30 pm, so I decided to get a late lunch and got a grilled cheese (again.)</p>

<p>Afterwards I took a scooter to the #adhd meetup, where I got a 3D printed empathy emoji that I jury-rigged to my badge; earlier that day Lyndsey showed me the trick to sticking the pronoun pin to my badge so now my badge looked a lot better. I also took the chance to print out and stick my avatar there and wrote all the projects I did under my name as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dit67Am.jpg" alt="picture of my XOXO badge" />
My XOXO badge, now complete</p>

<p>Several people told me over the past few days that they liked my pictures and thanked me for the calendar I made, which felt great.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t stay too long at the #adhd meetup as I was getting a bit tired and peopled out. I stopped by the ADX open house for a bit before going back to Rev Hall for all the evening activities.</p>

<p>I talked on twitter with <a href="https://twitter.com/jilliangmeehan">Jillian</a> who had <a href="https://snaxreport.com/">Snax</a>, her zine with her. I bought one and it&rsquo;s great; you should read it if you have the chance. It has an essay from <a href="https://twitter.com/summabis">Summer Farah</a> that&rsquo;s literally one of the best things I&rsquo;ve read this month.</p>

<p>The food trucks were opening a bit late, so I hung out more with people and finally ran into <a href="https://twitter.com/stickwithjosh">Josh</a>, who I&rsquo;ve been meaning to meet for quite a while. We had a good conversation and he told me that &ldquo;you have a whole vibe&rdquo; which I took as a high compliment.</p>

<p>After getting dinner once again from the Filippino cart, I walked around Arcade and checked out the games. I caught Nerdwriter at Video, then went to check out Tabletop. There were some cool games, however the place was very noisy and cramped and it was around that time my brain started shutting down.</p>

<p>I went back to Video to see Earworm (and ran into Sarah again); they showed a video that I&rsquo;ve seen before but it was still fun to watch it with others on the big screen. I went back to Arcade again and took pictures of the games I wanted to check out later, then back to Video for the final act, Unraveled. He showed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jcxc-ddWKI&amp;list=PLaDrN74SfdT7Ueqtwn_bXo1MuSWT0ji2w&amp;index=17&amp;t=0s">a video about calculating your pet&rsquo;s HP</a> and it was hilarious, well worth staying up late.</p>

<p>Then I took a Lyft home, showered and went to sleep.</p>

The excitement from the previous night lasted till the next morning as I woke up way too early, around 6 am. I had a Skype session with my therapist, then went to the La Luna Cafe for breakfast. The past week or so, I kept inviting XOXO friends, both old and new for a pre-registration breakfast.

<![CDATA[<p>(Previously: <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/25/xoxo-2019-prologue/">Prologue</a>, <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/26/xoxo-2019-part-1/">Part 1 - Monday</a>, <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/27/xoxo-2019-part-2/">Part 2 - Tuesday</a>, <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/28/xoxo-2019-part-3/">Part 3 - Wednesday</a>)</p>

<p>The excitement from the previous night lasted till the next morning as I woke up way too early, around 6 am. I had a Skype session with my therapist, then went to the La Luna Cafe for breakfast. The past week or so, I kept inviting XOXO friends, both old and new for a pre-registration breakfast. A lot of them came: Dan, <a href="https://twitter.com/emorydunn">Emory</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gravitytrope">Eliza</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/georgiecel">Georgie</a>, her husband <a href="https://twitter.com/nicholascooke">Nick</a>, her friend <a href="https://twitter.com/kylietimpani">Kylie</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewTheWhip">Andrew</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jwithy">Jim</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gamedesignerben">Ben</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/notdetails">Joel</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tiffalopolus">Tiffany</a> and I might be forgetting people. The food was the delicious and the company was great; by the end, though, I was a bit peopled out, and earlier that day something triggered my anxiety again, and I was starting to feel that.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/h1xnNuD.jpg" alt="group photo" />
The breakfast crew</p>

<p>The previous night I somehow managed to knock down my entire nightstand and my glasses got slightly bent, so I went to Myopic Optometry to fix them (you guessed it, someone recommended them on Slack.) Jim gave me a ride back to Revolution Hall for registration; we arrived almost at noon sharp. After picking up my badge and the swag, I started taking and printing portraits. I also met old and new friends as people started trickling in.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Wlkw0J4.jpg" alt="revhall" />

<p>I was planning on staying there for a couple of hours, but the sun was literally burning my skin, so after a lunch at Meat Cheese Bread where I got way too many grilled cheese sandwiches, I went to Push X Pull a couple blocks away to take a break. I hung out with <a href="https://twitter.com/lyyyndseyyy">Lyndsey</a> a bit there, then got some writing done. Georgie and Nick arrived shortly after, but we mostly just enjoyed each other&rsquo;s company in silence, if that&rsquo;s a thing (it&rsquo;s a thing.)</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NYiDatq.jpg" alt="georgie and nick" />

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2yfzPti.jpg" alt="insta" />
The printed photos</p>

<p>I went to the Metafilter meetup afterwards, though I didn&rsquo;t stay too long. I did take this portrait of Josh and Phil, though:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7x7BpnC.jpg" alt="josh and phil" />
Josh and Phil</p>

<p>The lack of sleep and the high anxiety was really getting to me, so I went back to my Airbnb. I took a long bath and a nap; they helped a bit.</p>

<p>I arrived back at Revolution Hall around 6. While waiting I ran into <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@annika">Annika</a> and her friends, got a Fronds pin and I admired her Raspberry Pi Zero/e-ink display project that she was wearing: it was showing stats from the XOXO Mastodon server that she&rsquo;s running. I took a few more portraits, including a really good one of <a href="https://twitter.com/notdetails">Joel</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/t8lpCsV.jpg" alt="Joel" />
Joel</p>

<p>More people trickled in. I ran into <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanw">Dylan</a> and had a random chat with someone who was also waiting for the park to open.</p>

<p>Once the clock hit 7 pm and the park opened for the opening party, I went straight for the food carts. I got dinner from the Filippino place and it was extremely good food. Rice, noodles, skewers of chicken and two pork egg rolls, all of them excellent. I topped them with a copious amount of sweet and sour/soy sauce.</p>

<p>For dessert I went to the Churros truck which did not disappoint either; it pains me that we only had them for the first two days.</p>

<p>I got to hang out with a lot of people at the opening party. I met Skyler and her friends: got a cute turtle sticker from her for my badge. I got to know <a href="https://twitter.com/theearlcarlson">Earl</a> who was having a small concert the next day. I chatted with with <a href="https://twitter.com/li3n3">Liene</a>, who I knew from the Slack but we didn&rsquo;t talk much in real life before. I met <a href="https://twitter.com/maxisnow">Max</a>, with whom we helped to save/migrate one of Andy McMillan&rsquo;s old sites a few weeks before; later I would take one of my favorite portraits of him. And I finally got to hang out with <a href="https://twitter.com/_loveallthis">Sarah</a>; we kind of knew each other from Twitter but never met before.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zijYL2Q.jpg" alt="badge" />
The turtle <em>is</em> really cute.</p>

<p>By 9 pm I was getting tired — the glass of wine I had didn&rsquo;t help — so I sat down at a table, where I met with Dunja again. She wasn&rsquo;t feeling that great either and it was great to commiserate with someone together over shared anxieties and such.</p>

<p>In the big tent, people were playing <a href="http://www.jsjoust.com/">Johann Sebastian Joust</a>; it looked fun, but there were a lot of people waiting for it, so I called it an evening just before 10 pm, went back to my Airbnb, took a shower, went to sleep.</p>

I’ve had an idea for a T-shirt for years, and the week before XOXO I finally acted on it. I wanted to have a T-shirt with “Helvetica” in big, bold letters. Here, this is how it looks like:
It’s cool, right? At first, it’s nothing special. It’s just “Helvetica” in Helvetica. Right?

<![CDATA[<p>(Previously: <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/25/xoxo-2019-prologue/">Prologue</a>, <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/26/xoxo-2019-part-1/">Part 1 - Monday</a>, <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/27/xoxo-2019-part-2/">Part 2 - Tuesday</a>)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had an idea for a T-shirt for years, and the week before XOXO I finally acted on it. I wanted to have a T-shirt with &ldquo;Helvetica&rdquo; in big, bold letters. Here, this is how it looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/K2QibN6.jpg" alt="Helvetica1" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s cool, right? At first, it&rsquo;s nothing special. It&rsquo;s just &ldquo;Helvetica&rdquo; in Helvetica. Right?</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/btVrpYH.jpg" alt="Helvetica2" /></p>

<p>There, I zoomed in a bit. Can you see it yet?</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re just confused right now, seriously, good for you. If you&rsquo;re a person who knows a thing or two about typography, however, your eyes might start twitching. That&rsquo;s because the font here is Arial, and this T-shirt is designed to piss off a certain kind of font nerd.</p>

<p>Anyways, it arrived the day before, so I decided it&rsquo;s a good day to wear it.</p>

<hr />

<p>The day started with breakfast at Zell&rsquo;s Cafe with Emory. The place was highly rated, but the food was somewhat disappointing: way too much cheese on my eggs, disappointing fries, bread that tasted weird. For dessert, we took scooters to Voodoo Donuts, which I still prefer over Blue Star, don&rsquo;t @ me (we can all agree that Pip&rsquo;s is excellent, though, right?)</p>

<p>We wanted to check out the Panic sign since Emory has never seen it before.  I managed to lead us six blocks the wrong way, so Emory took over GPS duties for the rest of the trip. I kept getting/feeling slightly lost in Portland throughout my whole stay and couldn&rsquo;t quite get a handle of the city — even though I&rsquo;ve been there twice before. My stress and anxiety might have had something to do with that.</p>

<p>We did get to the Panic sign eventually, but as it turns out, it&rsquo;s not much fun during daytime; you can barely see the colors.</p>

<p>Our next stop was the nearby Pendelton store, where I got not one but two coats for a redacted amount of money. They were beautiful coats, but I ended up returning both of them after the festival, as neither of them was quite the right cut for my weird body shape. If I&rsquo;m spending that much money on a cloth item, they better be a good fit.</p>

<p>I took a break at Powell&rsquo;s cafe, carefully not taking a look at the books because I have a giant backlog of them already. I did finally pick up <a href="https://twitter.com/heartshapedsky">Amy Baio&rsquo;s</a> <a href="https://youthinkyouknowme.cards/">You Think You Know Me</a>, though. It is, in a way, an investment in my future as I don&rsquo;t have too many people I can play it with right now.</p>

<p>It was around that time I connected with Dunja, Robert and Djordje, who arrived the day before; we met up in front of Revolution Hall just before 2 pm. I met Dunja at XOXO 2016; she was one of the few people from Eastern Europe. She introduced me to Robert in 2018, who&rsquo;s also from Hungary; we hung out a bunch the past year. I haven&rsquo;t met Djordje before; it was his first XOXO. He was Dunja&rsquo;s friend from Serbia.</p>

<p>I saw on Twitter that Andrew just got in town and was looking for something to do so I invited him along.</p>

<p>We walked around the city, north on SE 13th St. then turned right on E Burnside St, wandering around and exploring the city for at least an hour. We ended up in Laurelhurst Park, which was pretty beautiful. After a short break, we each went our separate ways: Andrew to a museum, Dunja &amp; co to get SIM cards and I walked to Belmont to get a late lunch.</p>

<p>I found a place called Straight From New York Pizza, and they had decent slices, though the New York part felt like a bit of a stretch.</p>

<p>Anticipating a high anxiety day as something triggered that the day before, I booked a massage at the Common Ground Wellness Co-op that someone recommended on the Slack. They were my next stop; I took a Lyft there. After checking in, I got undressed — the place is clothing optional — and had a great massage I really needed. Afterwards, I relaxed in their hot tub. It was a great place, and I would probably be a regular if I&rsquo;d be living in Portland.</p>

<p>Once done, I took another Lyft back to APEX, for the now-traditional pre-XOXO Wednesday night beers. I got to have a great conversation with Andy McMillan, Jonah, Crystal, Dan and a few other people whose name escape me right now. Andy told us about his zero-proof cocktail bar, and we also learned quite a bit about Northern Ireland. For dinner, I got a rice bowl from a Vietnamese place across the street; it was pretty okay. It was a fantastic evening; it was there where I started feeling the energy XOXO gives you, and that carried me through the rest of the week. That, and all the fantastic people.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5qxyTGQ.jpg" alt="Andy and Henry" />
Andy and Henry. So cute. Henry, that is (Andy if you&rsquo;re reading this you look great as well.)</p>

<p>I got back to my Airbnb around 11, and it took me a while to fall asleep: I was pretty excited about the next few days. XOXO would be (officially) starting the next day.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>(Previously: <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/25/xoxo-2019-prologue/">Prologue</a>, <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/26/xoxo-2019-part-1/">Part 1 - Monday</a>)</p>

<p>Look, I know that Scooters Are Bad, but the thing is, they are also <em>really fun</em>. So I put up with the minuscule amount of guilt I had about that and decided to use scooters as much as possible during my stay in Portland. And on Tuesday, I devised myself a challenge.</p>

<p>I was going to hang out with <a href="https://twitter.com/joshmillard">Josh</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/angelapiller">Angela</a> at their place (and then visit a few other spots.) Besides wanting to see them — they are my friends and I love them very much — I also wanted to check out all the art Josh produced the last year, and see his amazing stained glass pieces in person.</p>

<p>They live way up in St. Johns, at the northwestern part of Portland; my Airbnb was at SE. Would it be possible for me to get to their place by scooters only? I had to try.</p>

<p>I ended up taking two scooters, and I got pretty far: my second scooter died about 1.5 miles from their place. Unfortunately, there weren&rsquo;t any around, so I walked a bit and took a bus the rest of the way.</p>

<p><em>(This was probably the first time I tried the Spin scooters, which turned out to be much better than the Lime ones; they were lighter and much quicker to accelerate. I stuck to mostly using them for the rest of the trip.)</em></p>

<p>Josh&rsquo;s stained glass pieces are truly amazing to see; pictures don&rsquo;t do them justice. If I ever get rich enough that I can drop several hundred dollars on art — and then some on shipping extremely fragile glass across the Atlantic — Josh&rsquo;s work will be the first thing I&rsquo;ll buy.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ii7gzy7.jpg" alt="stained glass" />
Again, the pictures really don&rsquo;t do justice, but I tried.</p>

<p>Next, we went to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cathedralcoffeeshop/">Cathedral Coffee</a> to get cinnamon rolls; they have by far the best ones I&rsquo;ve had outside of Sweden, topped with a cream cheese frosting. We went there last year, but I was eager to have them again. I also tried their raspberry roll, which was not quite as good as the cinnamon version, but still pretty damn tasty.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PT2Wk7U.jpg" alt="buns" />
So. Good.</p>

<p>With breakfast done, we went to visit Josh and Angela&rsquo;s friends, who have a fascinating not-quite-tiny house in the neighborhood. The place is impressive, both inside and outside. The house is painted in the colors of the rainbow, with each piece of wood being a part of a gradient.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xr5DvLF.jpg" alt="house" />
(I was a dumdum and only took a picture of the place with them on it. However, they told me that they don&rsquo;t want their pictures on the internet, hence the censorship.)</p>

<h4 id="interlude-my-xoxo-projects">Interlude: My XOXO projects</h4>

<p>It was there I first did my XOXO Thing, which is taking pictures of people and printing it out for them. For the photos, I use my iPhone, and I have two instant printers. One is Fuji&rsquo;s Instax Share SP-2 that uses the polaroid-like Instax Mini film; the other is a Paperang P1 thermal printer — I use that with sticker paper. Both have a unique look and feel, and people loved them at the previous XOXOs, so I decided to do it again. I continued taking pictures throughout the festival and collected the photos at <a href="https://facesofxoxo2019.ktamas.com">https://facesofxoxo2019.ktamas.com</a>.</p>

<p>I had a few other projects this year as well. I helped to put together the <a href="https://xoxo.bingo">XOXO bingo</a>; I collected and put together the new clues, <a href="https://twitter.com/juliaskott">Julia Skott</a> did the fantastic artwork and <a href="https://twitter.com/rileyjshaw">Riley Shaw</a> handled the coding. I think we did an excellent job and a lot of people enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Finally, like last year, I put together a Google Calendar people could subscribe to with the complete schedule of the festival as well as all the Social meetups. A lot of people used it and thanked me for it over the long weekend.</p>

<p>Last but not least I was the de-facto co-organizer the Tim Tam Slam Jam, for which I brought like 12 packs of biscuits, which I thought would be too much but turned out to be just what we needed. It was a huge success, drawing by far the largest crowd so far. For next year I suggest that the Andys approach the manufacturer to sponsor the festival and give a complimentary package of Tim Tams as swag to each attendee.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/25xFwCi.jpg" alt="timtams" />
Ready to slam.</p>

<hr />

<p>After meeting Josh and Angela&rsquo;s friends, we got lunch at the Mississippi Pizza Pub; they had a perfectly decent slice of pizza, though it wasn&rsquo;t anything special (I was told the place is quite popular.) After that, we parted ways, and I went by the Pendelton store, which is always a weak spot for me, but I didn&rsquo;t buy anything&hellip; that day.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I felt pretty crummy the rest of the day. I went back to the Airbnb and tried to rest for a few hours, without much success, then took a Lyft to the Drink and Draw at Bye Bye. They didn&rsquo;t have any food I liked, so I got a few grilled cheese sandwiches around the corner. I had a good chat with <a href="https://twitter.com/juanbuis">Juan</a>, who I ran into just as I was sitting down. Afterwards I went back to Bye Bye, and hung out there for about two hours; I got to chat with <a href="https://twitter.com/bookymargoof">Becky</a> a bit as well as a few other folks I didn&rsquo;t know. Around 9 pm, I took a Lyft back to my Airbnb and went to sleep.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>(Previously: <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/25/xoxo-2019-prologue/">Prologue</a>)</p>

<p>I arrived at Portland on Labor Day. I intended to spend as much time in Portland as possible (and financially viable.) I knew from experience that even before the opening party on Thursday, there could be plenty of opportunities to hang out with people. Folks who live in Portland and others who also get in town a few days before.</p>

<p>One of the advantages of flying in from Canada is you get past CBP early, on the Canadian side: once you land in the US, you go directly to picking up your suitcases.</p>

<p>The US border is always a stressful place because of <em>gestures at all the horror stories you can read on the internet</em> but once again I cleared customs without significant issues. I got a big &ldquo;X&rdquo; on my returning ESTA slip because I said yes to the question &ldquo;are you bringing any food, livestock, etc.&rdquo; which was technically correct: I had twelve packs of Tim Tams in my suitcase. The fingerprint reader really didn&rsquo;t like my right hand at the first border agent, so he redirected me to another one, where I finally got the OK I needed. In the process, I got to tell the border agent about XOXO, which meant I could check off the &ldquo;tell someone about XOXO who hasn&rsquo;t heard of it&rdquo; box in the <a href="https://xoxo.bingo">XOXO bingo</a>, something I worked on this year; more on that later.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JHEgUOF.jpg" alt="PDX" />
Hello, PDX.</p>

<p>After an uneventful flight, I took a Lyft to our AirBnB; we arrived almost at the same time with <a href="https://twitter.com/emorydunn">Emory</a>. The place we found had a great location: just four blocks from Revolution Hall, on the corner of SE Taylor and 13th. It had mostly great reviews, and it served its purpose, but neither of us was terribly happy with it. It had an odd layout, one of the beds were way too soft — at least for me —, the washing machine was small and slow and the wifi was absolutely terrible the whole time we were there.</p>

<p>We got a late lunch with Emory at the Rogue Eastside Pub &amp; Pilot Brewery; then I took a scooter (well, two) to NE at the Dillingers Barber Shop, where I had an appointment with Emily. Someone recommended her on Slack, and she delivered; it was one of the best beard trims I&rsquo;ve ever had. It pains me that after moving back to Hungary almost three years ago, I still can&rsquo;t find a reliable barbershop. The best trims I&rsquo;ve had in the past couple years were in San Francisco, New York and now Portland, respectively.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/T4I1esX.jpg" alt="Selfie" />
She really did a great job.</p>

<p>I got a couple of essentials in the Whole Foods across the street — you should not travel with an open bottle of Dr. Bronner&rsquo;s, ask me how I know — then I took a scooter downtown to Oven and Shaker, where I met up with <a href="https://twitter.com/fledglingnerd">Sarah</a>, Emory and <a href="https://twitter.com/juanbuis">Juan</a>. I was particularly excited to see Sarah again; I&rsquo;ll never forget <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/08/14/xoxo-2016/#tuesday-a-surprise-dinner">the kindness she showed on my first XOXO</a>, and she remains one of my favorite people, the best XOXO mom. She welcomed me saying how good to see me and how &ldquo;XOXO starts for me when I first see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had a good dinner, talked a lot, caught up with each other, then Sarah took us home to our respective Airbnbs. I was anxious throughout the whole thing, but it was still great to hang out with everyone.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gqgS8Qk.jpg" alt="Us" />
Us.</p>

<p>And that was the end of day 1: XOXO has begun.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>A friend told me a few years before, that &ldquo;XOXO is a place full of people you want to hang out with all the time,&rdquo; and boy was he right. In 2016, I got to attend the first time, and I was hooked and <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/08/14/xoxo-2016/">had a blast</a>. Two years later I was back (I have yet to write that one up), and it was a different experience: so much has happened in those two years. And not just in the world, but also on a personal level. I became very active on the Slack, and I spent much of XOXO 2018 trying to meet all the people I only met online. That year the festival was bigger and in a different venue, and yeah, it was different, but it was still very much XOXO.</p>

<p>When the Andys made clear that in 2019 they&rsquo;d go back to the old size, I was somewhat conflicted. On the one hand, I understood the toll it took on them and everyone else organizing the festival, having it twice as big. There was also a fair amount of feedback from the community that the larger size didn&rsquo;t work for them. I personally had a good time and got to meet a lot of people I wanted to, but that&rsquo;s <em>my</em> experience. The venue and the location were, in many ways, indeed worse. I was also worried, in a selfish but understandable way that with the smaller size I&rsquo;m going to need more luck to get picked in the lottery for a ticket. In the last year or so the XOXO Slack became an even more significant part of my online life and the thought of not going felt, frankly, unbearable.</p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;m writing about this, I obviously got lucky and got a ticket to XOXO this year as well; and I feel pretty confident saying that this year has been the best one I&rsquo;ve attended so far. The smaller size indeed works better, and Revolution Hall is possibly the best location it can have, even with its (very minor) downsides.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written this as a travelogue because that&rsquo;s the only way I know how to. Let&rsquo;s get started, shall we?</p>

<h2 id="a-not-so-quick-detour-about-my-mental-health-because-we-talk-about-this-stuff-in-this-community">A not-so-quick detour about my mental health because we talk about this stuff in this community</h2>

<p>XOXO 2019 caught me at a particularly bad and vulnerable time. The previous few months were rough, mental health-wise — I became pretty isolated. I had a daily routine that kept me together and sane, though: I was moving between safe spaces. Wake up, get breakfast, go to my regular cafe, get work done, get home, order in something for dinner, binge on TV shows, go to sleep. Lather, rinse, repeat.</p>

<p>In the first half of 2019, I was on a 6-month therapy break. It was a necessary thing and in many ways, helpful; but by the end, I knew I needed to start again. After a false start, I got a new therapist late June and we clicked almost instantly. However, what was understandable but bad for my mental health is the fact that he took the entire month of August off for vacation.</p>

<p>I ended up going on a month-long trip, starting mid-August: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and finally Portland for XOXO. I thought all the travel, and going to new and exciting places — I&rsquo;ve never been to Canada before — would make me feel better. Instead, the opposite happened.</p>

<p>All that structure I mentioned earlier suddenly disappeared and my mental health took a nosedive. I had a panic attack on the third day of the trip, which I mostly weathered thanks to an XOXOer who reached out — thank you, <a href="https://twitter.com/scruss">Stewart</a>. For the rest of the trip, I was in a constant state of varying levels of anxiety, which is really not what I was going for.</p>

<p>After Toronto and Montreal (and back to Toronto for a few days), my next stop was Vancouver for a couple days with <a href="https://twitter.com/emorydunn">Emory</a>, who I met at last year&rsquo;s XOXO. I admit I was anxious about it: traveling with someone who you barely know can go both ways. In this case, it worked out pretty well for us, and it also improved my mental health quite a bit. Being around people, in general, helps; being around people I like and am comfortable with makes a much more significant difference, and I had a good time with him.</p>

<p>By the time I arrived in Portland, I felt, well, not great, but better. The kind of anxiety where your emotions get numbed down and much of what you feel is the anxiety itself followed me through my time in Portland and XOXO, unfortunately. That being said, I still had an absolute blast, and again: this was by far the best XOXO I&rsquo;ve been to so far.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-xoxo">What is XOXO?</h2>

<p>Not everyone reading this knows what <a href="http://xoxofest.com">XOXO</a> is or how it works, so I&rsquo;m going to start this series with an overview. If you do, <a href="#beginnings-before-the-festival">skip to the next section</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>The tagline of XOXO is &ldquo;An experimental festival for independent artists who live and work online,&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s pretty accurate? It&rsquo;s usually held the weekend after Labor Day, early September and runs for four days, between Thursday evening and Sunday night. It&rsquo;s held at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/fDRB1fgzvrPwRBUJ8">Revolution Hall in Portland, Oregon</a>. It was created by two Andys, Andy Baio and Andy McMillan, who still run it (with the help others of course, as well as dozens of volunteers). It was held every year since 2012 except for 2017. It&rsquo;s extremely well-organized; once you&rsquo;ve been to XOXO, no other conference or festival measures up in terms of organization, attention to detail and listening to the input of attendants.</p>

<hr />

<p>Schedule-wise, Thursday evening is the opening party; Friday is Social during the day, during which attendees self-organize different meetups around interests and Slack channels (more on that soon). Friday and Saturday evening hosts several topical events: Arcade (videogames), Tabletop (boardgames), Video (in 2016 it was called Film &amp; Animation) and Story (podcasts and storytelling). <a href="https://xoxofest.com/2016">Here&rsquo;s the 2016 schedule</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The conference itself is during Saturday and Sunday with talks from a variety of speakers. It&rsquo;s wrapped up with a closing party that usually features a surprise musical guest on Sunday night.</p>

<hr />

<p>To get tickets for the festival, you have to fill out a brief questionnaire — that&rsquo;s only there to weed out marketers —  and after that, you enter a lottery. If you get picked, you have 48 hours to buy your ticket (pass).</p>

<p>The questions are the following:
- Who are you and what do you do?
- What are you working on right now!!
- Something you made that you&rsquo;re proud of</p>

<p>There are two kinds of passes: conference for $500 and festival only for $250. A festival pass gives you access to everything except the conference talks; however, you will see them anyway live, streamed to a bar downstairs. They are also recorded and later <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqMG_BBwxrhLG80Y3yuEu-Q">uploaded to Youtube</a>. The conference pass is self-explanatory.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you get a ticket, you get an invite to the private Slack, which is a massive part of the whole thing, and where a lot of people hang out before, during and after the festival. It has hundreds of channels for all kinds of topics and interests (#tv, #fitness, #star-trek, #knitting and so on) as well as local channels (#vancouver, #europe, #nyc and so on) and other miscellaneous channels, such as one for venting about random life stuff. It also hosts a sizeable amount of private channels for womxn, people of color, LGBTQIA+, non-binary people, people with disabilities (&ldquo;spoonies&rdquo;) and mental-health-related things.</p>

<p>The XOXO Slack is a pretty great place; not everyone who comes to the festival joins, though. During the festival, it gets especially busy; a lot of communication and organization happens there as well as on Twitter.</p>

<hr />

<p>At least 85-90% of the people who go to XOXO are American; within that, the majority of people probably come from the west coast (and within that, a sizeable amount of people come from the Pacific Northwest). It&rsquo;s also, by far and large, a pretty radically left-leaning place. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://explore.xoxofest.com/guide/conduct">code of conduct</a> which is very much enforced both offline and online.</p>

<hr />

<p>All of this feels a bit dry, but I think it is an important context for the rest of the series. XOXO is unlike any event I&rsquo;ve ever attended, in a good way; a unique experience that everyone should try at least once if they can (and the above sounds appealing). I&rsquo;ve met a lot of great people there and made friends I still have to this day.</p>

<p><a id="Beginnings"></a></p>

<h2 id="beginnings-before-the-festival">Beginnings — Before the Festival</h2>

<p>Impostor syndrome runs deep within the community of XOXO, and so is the acknowledgment of it, so let&rsquo;s start with that.</p>

<p>I applied for XOXO at least once before, in 2014, because a friend of mine also did. And I remember that even back then, I was staring at the survey questions (see <a href="https://writetogether.space/posts/ktamas/what-is-xoxo-anyway">yesterday&rsquo;s post</a>), and feeling something like this:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t belong here. XOXO is a place for makers, artists, creators — I am not one of them. Or, maybe I am, but I don&rsquo;t do anything visible. I&rsquo;m just a guy who finds all these people interesting and would love to meet them, but <em>I</em> am not interesting. I don&rsquo;t do anything that would qualify as me being worthwhile of XOXO.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I filled it out anyway, sent it in — and the random generator did not pick me. It did pick my friend who went and had a blast, though; he said it was full of people who &ldquo;you want to hang out with all the time&rdquo; so I took note that this is a cool thing and I should try it sometime.</p>

<p>About two years later, the application form popped up again, in <a href="https://waxy.org/">Andy Baio&rsquo;s linkblog</a>. Okay, whatever, let&rsquo;s apply, maybe I slip through the cracks and get lucky with the lottery this time?</p>

<p>My feelings from years before haven&rsquo;t changed much. I didn&rsquo;t have a sexy side-project up on Github to show. I had a very unsexy job: a freelance consultant, a jack-of-all-trades generalist working in IT. That&rsquo;s still my job.</p>

<p>I wrote something about being a community organizer. Which is true — I like making and organizing communities. I am not half bad at it, although I am am very aware of my severe shortcomings as well. I sent in the form and went back to whatever I was doing.</p>

<p>I was traveling a lot at the time, and it must have been about a month after I applied when I woke up in my Airbnb in Riga, Latvia and saw an email: I got one of the late-last-minute festival passes. I had 48 hours to buy it and a couple of weeks to refund it if I change my mind.</p>

<p>I was surprised. I knew that the &lsquo;regular&rsquo; tickets were sent out already, and I did not get any email, so I resigned myself to my fate — oh well, no XOXO for me.</p>

<p>And now this email.</p>

<p>Huh.</p>

<p>The ticket was refundable for like three weeks after buying it, so I figured I&rsquo;ll buy it in any case. I still had time to change my mind.</p>

<p>I started checking the flights to Portland, feeling a not-so-vague itch for visiting NYC before that, but eventually convincing myself that no, I&rsquo;ll just go for Portland, visit XOXO, then go back home. I just committed myself to a bunch of other things anyway; so I got a return flight from Gothenburg to Portland.</p>

<p>But I was going to XOXO.</p>

<p>After getting my ticket, I joined the Slack for the festival, wrote a long intro into #intro channel, and started getting to know people. I wrote about it in the <a href="https://writetogether.space/posts/ktamas/what-is-xoxo-anyway">first part of this series</a>; over the last three years, it&rsquo;s become a massive part of my social life on the internet.</p>

<p>After finishing up my trip to Eastern Europe, I went to Germany for a week for a work project. Once that was wrapped up, I was back home in Sweden, telling my therapist how miserable I was. My friend Jane wanted me to fix her computer; Joe wanted me to decide if I will sell my phone to him or not and so on. I also took on a bunch of other responsibilities to keep myself busy, because I suddenly found myself with a lot of time on my hands. I told him all that and the fact that I was tired of it all, and I just wanted to leave everything and go to New York. He pointed it out that this can be simple: if I don&rsquo;t want to fix Jane&rsquo;s computer, or sell Joe my phone, I can say no; if I want to go to New York, I can go. I had time, and I had the money.</p>

<p>That was Friday morning. By Friday evening, I rented out my apartment, had my ticket for my flight on Sunday, booked two Airbnbs and was ready to go. I was going to the USA for a month.</p>

<p>Those three weeks in NYC were amazing, exhausting and draining. I love that city, and it overwhelms me, and I am tempted to write a few more paragraphs about it, but that&rsquo;s not <em>this</em> story. (You can check out that story <a href="https://writetogether.space/users/ktamas">on WriteTogether</a>, I have about 19 posts about it)</p>

<hr />

<p>My digital XOXO experience started on the Slack, but the real-life one started earlier than the festival.</p>

<p>When I was in New York, someone organized a pre-conference meetup at the Lavender Lake bar. I didn&rsquo;t know anyone there in person (I did join the Slack just weeks before after I got my ticket), and frankly it was a bit intimidating at first: all these cool people, many of them working at interesting tech companies. Someone just left Spotify; someone else just started working at Meetup. Another person was working for Tumblr! I was starstruck, in many ways.</p>

<p>But I quickly became comfortable and had great conversations. I got to know Skyler, Allison, PBJ, Darrell, Kate, Jason, Scott, Leigh and others I don&rsquo;t remember right now. I remember Darrell showing off his <a href="https://www.containerstore.com/s/office/tech-accessories/gostrap-phone-strap/12d?productId=10035812">goStrap</a> on his phone, a thing I&rsquo;ve never seen before; later in the evening I enthusiastically told the story of <a href="https://writetogether.space/posts/ktamas/the-as-of-yet-unwritten-oral-history-of-turulcsirip-an-early-twitter-client-and-community">Turulcsirip</a> to Scott and Leigh. We&rsquo;ve made plans to hang at XOXO again, and many of us did.</p>

<p>Everyone was extremely welcoming, and there was a strong sense of community that I came to appreciate at XOXO. In many ways, the meetup was already XOXO and everything that&rsquo;s good about it. Three years later <a href="https://writetogether.space/posts/ktamas/day-7-park-slope-and-beyond">I&rsquo;d be the one to organize an XOXO meetup in Lavender Lake</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>A few days before that the <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80057691">XOXO movie</a> was released by Netflix, which had nothing to do with the festival (this was quite a bit of a headache for the Andys). I watched it alone, but then I watched it again a few days later with everyone on Slack, and it was a lot of fun.</p>

<hr />

<p>After my NYC trip and a quick detour to Minnesota, I arrived in Portland on a Tuesday morning, not realizing that the festival starts that day, at least unofficially.</p>

<p><a id="Tuesday"></a></p>

<h2 id="tuesday-a-surprise-dinner">Tuesday — A Surprise Dinner</h2>

<p>Arriving in Portland, I was filled with the excitement that comes from visiting a new place, a novelty that always wears off, but I try to enjoy it as much as I can.</p>

<p>My Airbnb was pretty great, even though it had two cats. I&rsquo;m not good with pets, but the owner said the cats are not allowed in the guest spaces and it worked out. The cats left me alone, and the first time in my life I was pretty much not bothered them being around.</p>

<p><em>(&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not good with pets&rdquo; is kind of an understatement: by far and large, I don&rsquo;t like pets. I have my reasons. I feel like a terrible person just writing this, but there, I said it. Hi, I am Tamas, and even though everyone I meet seems to like a) cats b) dogs c) both, I don&rsquo;t.)</em></p>

<p>The Airbnb was at a great location (around SE 35th Pl and Hawthorne), so I just started walking around in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>After an hour or two, I came to understand that yes, Portlandia is in many ways a documentary, but that&rsquo;s not at all a problem. Hawthorne, the neighboorhood is really cool, full of cafes, vintage stores and great food places.</p>

<p>I had a very forgettable lunch at <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/rice-junkies-portland-6">Rice Junkies</a> then got dessert at <a href="https://www.bluestardonuts.com">Blue Star Donuts</a> next door. I didn&rsquo;t really like their stuff; I prefer the yeasty kind of donuts, which is why my favorite in Portland is <a href="https://www.voodoodoughnut.com/">Voodoo Doughnuts</a>.</p>

<p>In the early afternoon, I headed Downtown to <a href="https://www.powells.com/">Powell&rsquo;s</a>, the legendary bookstore. It&rsquo;s a great place though somewhat overwhelming; there is a reason that around that time I banned myself from bookstores.</p>

<p>By the afternoon, I was kind of bored and aimless, sitting at a Starbucks, so I asked on Slack if anyone wants to do a pre-pre-XOXO hangout. I only got a few replies. Andy McMillan said he might be up for something in the evening, though he said he&rsquo;d be working; and <a href="https://twitter.com/fledglingnerd">Sarah</a>, someone I didn&rsquo;t know also mentioned that she might be available.</p>

<p>In the evening, I asked again, and not much response came — until a few minutes later when I got a private message from Sarah, who invited me for dinner to her house, which turned out to be about 5 minutes from my Airbnb.</p>

<p>This caught me completely off-guard. A stranger inviting me to dinner? To her house? The day I arrived?</p>

<hr />

<p>Let&rsquo;s stop here for a second to talk about extremely stereotypical cultural differences. Let me stress that: these are unscientific, personal experiences and observances, fused with bad stereotypes, and I know the reality is far more nuanced, but this is the only way I can tell this story.</p>

<p>I am Hungarian: we often don&rsquo;t like each other very much, especially when we live abroad: we avoid each other, or form cliques. I personally try to avoid Hungarians outside of Hungary as much as possible.</p>

<p>Hungary has never felt like home for me, and I was extremely glad when I was able to move to Sweden. At the time, I was living there for more than 3 years, and it was the first place I felt home.</p>

<p>But.</p>

<p>After moving to Sweden, I quickly became aware that I do not fit in society well, nor I have a desire to do so. I didn&rsquo;t have the same aspirations of someone Swedish. I didn&rsquo;t like the language (though that changed later) and had almost no motivation to learn it since almost everyone spoke good English and my work did not require me to speak Swedish. I found myself an international church pretty quickly, which helped me to have a social life for the first few years, and in the last year or so there I started having more friends outside of the church. Expats living here, students on Erasmus or doing their masters, etc. I had friends, and I was grateful for them, but the fact remained: I lived in a society where I felt like I could not connect with the majority of the people and that&rsquo;s kind of isolating and lonely.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I am at least half-American in my heart: I&rsquo;ve always been able to get along well with Americans, and I fit into the society a lot better; I can connect to people. And after more than 3 years of Sweden, being in a country where I could connect with people was <em>amazing</em>.</p>

<p>Still, I have not expected a dinner invitation from a stranger. Nevertheless, I have gladly accepted and was welcomed. As Sarah was cooking dinner — veggies, pasta, shrimps — we had a great conversation. She told me about the Thorns, the local women&rsquo;s soccer team and the huge fanbase behind it, and even though I don&rsquo;t care much about soccer (except every two years when there is a World Cup or a Eurocup), she made it sound really interesting, even inviting me to a game the next day.</p>

<p>I think one of the mental breakthroughs I had came shortly after that. I was still nervous and told Sarah that this might be the time to be extremely rude. Without missing a beat, she said &ldquo;Oh, good. I like rude.&rdquo; I told her I&rsquo;m an extremely picky eater and besides the pasta she just put into that big pot, I do not like any of the veggies nor the shrimp there.</p>

<p>I was not judged, nor mocked, but instead offered to join her daughter having pasta with tomato sauce and cheese and I am forever grateful for that.</p>

<p>Later that night, Sarah and I went to APEX, a pub, to hang out Andy McMillan, who was still very busy working on XOXO, but nevertheless had some time to chat with us. I felt like being in the presence of a celebrity. Just how amazing is a festival when the very first time you&rsquo;re in town, you get a dinner invitation and later hang out with one of the organizers?</p>

<p><a id="Wednesday"></a></p>

<h2 id="wednesday-the-day-before">Wednesday — The Day Before</h2>

<p>Wednesday morning, we watched the Apple keynote together on the Slack in #apple — so weird being in the &ldquo;right&rdquo; timezone for once — and commented through it, which was heaps of fun. After that, I picked up my rental camera for XOXO, a Fuji X-Pro 2 with a 56mm f/1.2 lens.</p>

<p>In the evening we had beers at APEX again, this time, with a lot more people. It was fun, and I had some great conversations, including one with someone called Mary, though that&rsquo;s all I can remember (if you&rsquo;re Mary and are reading this somehow: hi!). I was somewhat underdressed and freezing, though, and a bit under myself (likely slightly exhausted from the overwhelming Tuesday) so I ended up leaving early.</p>

<p><a id="Thursday"></a></p>

<h2 id="thursday-mefi-meetup-opening-party">Thursday — MeFi Meetup, Opening Party</h2>

<p>Thursday morning, about a dozen of us met up at <a href="https://goodwith.us/">Good Coffee</a>. I got to know a couple of people — <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickbjohnson">Patrick</a>! John! Others! — as well as meeting up with someone I&rsquo;ve met at the XOXO meetup in New York (hi, <a href="https://twitter.com/drldCsta">Darrell</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanluikens">Ryan</a> and <a href="https://facesofxoxo2016.tumblr.com/post/150269612573/ben-johnson-gamedesignerben">Ben</a>). Around 12, we walked to Revolution Hall to pick up our badges and the obligatory swag.</p>

<p><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/140c0866675241ca0258c7702fa5c838/tumblr_odd4gdwDEH1vffpu1o1_1280.jpg" alt="Patrick" />

Darrell</p>

<p>The badges were amazing. In some ways, I was happy that I only had a festival-only pass,  as it was pink and looked a lot cooler than the yellow conference one. We got pins — I think we could pick two — which were retro-themed, but all had &ldquo;XOXO&rdquo; on them. I also managed to score the secret pin from Andy McMillan, which was the NeXT logo.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/n7sNqDM.jpg" alt="pins" /></p>

<p>We walked a couple blocks to a restaurant, only to find it closed, so we went back to Revolution Hall and had sandwiches at <a href="https://meatcheesebread.com/">Meat Cheese Bread</a>, right next to the venue. That&rsquo;s when I met with <a href="https://twitter.com/DunjaLazic">Dunja</a> and a couple of other people as well. She was the only person I got to know there who was also from Eastern Europe.</p>

<p><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/8641ddeecbbc9a80ff09843fc4bfe42d/tumblr_odcqc8QHLd1vffpu1o1_1280.jpg" alt="Dunja" />
Dunja</p>

<p>Early afternoon I got to know <a href="https://twitter.com/ow">Owen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sehsarah">Sarah</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chrstnerode">Christine</a>; we took Biketown rides to Downtown to a cafe called Barista, where we hung out for a while.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I went back to the other side of the river for the Metafilter meetup at Rogue Eastside Pub.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a member of the site for years, but this was my first meetup, and I loved it. I had a bunch of great conversations and got to know <a href="https://twitter.com/joshmillard">Josh</a> (aka Cortex) and Angela (aka Secretariat), his wife, among other people. I also took a few good portraits along the way and handed them out; people enjoyed them a lot, Josh <a href="https://twitter.com/joshmillard/status/774040934400995328">tweeted about it</a> and <a href="http://art.joshmillard.com/2016/04/26/selfportrait-after-a-polaroid-photo-by-tamas/">even made a painting out of it</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ed894d428cd9372a077947dc2b3c6e5/tumblr_odd0ooCcus1vffpu1o1_1280.jpg" alt="Josh" />
Josh</p>

<p>See, I had a magic trick. It&rsquo;s a pricy one, and it&rsquo;s only magic once, but it&rsquo;s pretty damn good: I take portraits of people and after a minute hand it to them. It&rsquo;s printed on a polaroid, or to be more precise, a Fuji Instax Mini film. The camera I rented combined with the Fuji Instax SP-2 mobile printer I had is what makes all this happen.</p>

<p>The meetup wrapped up in time for the opening party, which marked the official start of XOXO. It was probably a few minutes into the party where it really hit me: There are over a thousand interesting people here, and most of the time, I can just walk up and talk with them! With anyone! It&rsquo;s amazing!</p>

<p>I had a lot of conversations with a lot of great people that night. A few highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Two minutes of awkward fanboying with <a href="https://twitter.com/jessiechar">Jessie Char</a>, with something like &ldquo;Hi! I loved the, uh, the Mule Podcast you did and I especially loved the makeup tutorial you did on periscope once and I am a huge fan and can I take your picture and here it is printed hope you like it&rdquo;. She was delighted that someone remembered that one periscope.</li>
<li>Meeting James and a few other people from Backerkit</li>
<li>The food truck Cereal from a Van, which is exactly its namesake: you could have a bowl of cereal (with unlimited refills!) for like $3. They had a huge selection of cereals (and milk) and made recommendations if asked for. The whole thing should have been ridiculous but somehow wasn&rsquo;t; maybe because it was so earnest. I had cereal every single day of XOXO from that van. On the opening night, someone started a pay-it-forward chain that literally lasted the entire party.</li>
<li>I met <a href="https://twitter.com/duien">Emily</a>, and she was great.</li>
<li>I also had the chance the first time in my life to chat with someone with adult ADHD, thanks to the Slack. I asked not long before the festival if there were others with adult ADHD, and we could maybe chat? Two people said yes; I had lunch with the other guy on Sunday.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was an amazing day, and I had no idea how much more fun I&rsquo;d have in the next few.</p>

<p><a id="Friday"></a></p>

<h2 id="friday-social-arcade-story">Friday — Social, Arcade, Story</h2>

<p>Friday started for me with morning yoga on top of Revolution Hall, which I really needed. For breakfast, I got donuts at <a href="http://www.pipsmobile.com/">Pip&rsquo;s</a> then got in line for <a href="http://www.friedegglove.com/">Fried Eggs I&rsquo;m in Love</a>, who sold the best breakfast sandwiches I&rsquo;ve ever had. While waiting, I met up with <a href="https://twitter.com/hello_skyler">Skyler</a> again, who I got to know at the XOXO meetup and got to chat with <a href="https://twitter.com/tiffysniffs">Tiffany</a>, who had a really cool &ldquo;Keeping it Corny&rdquo; pin that I immediately bought from her (you can buy it <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/463022590/keep-it-corny-125-hard-enamel-pin">here</a>).</p>

My face looks terrible but look at that pin.</p>

<p>After listening to the Andys&rsquo; opening remarks, the Social part of the festival started. The first one I went to was the #photography meetup, a photowalk organized by <a href="https://twitter.com/microwavenby">Sasha</a>. We walked around Portland and took loads of pictures, including photos of people taking photos, which is pretty much a photowalk tradition.</p>

<p><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/81319956d1d5fe70ad3499a6a554c404/tumblr_odcr91eQxI1vffpu1o1_1280.jpg" alt="Ryan" />

<p>I chatted with <a href="https://twitter.com/katieelambert">Katie</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sarita__alami">Sarita</a> from Mailchimp; one of them were/are the one responsible for all the podcasts sponsorships, which sounded like the coolest job ever (still does). I took their portraits, and it ended up on the company&rsquo;s Snapchat.</p>

<p>Done with my snack, I made my way to the Panic offices where they had an open house. They have a pretty cool space, and there were loads of people hanging out. Highlights include seeing a working <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">NeXT</a> computer and getting my picture taking with the walkie-talkie from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/383870/Firewatch/">Firewatch</a>, one of my favorite videogames.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MZFesxV.jpg" alt="Firewatch" /></p>

<p>I kind of crashed around 3 pm, so I went back to my Airbnb to rest.</p>

<p>My evening was split between Story and Arcade. At Arcade, I played with <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/headmaster-ps4/">Headmaster</a>, a game for the Playstation VR (which, back then was still in beta). It was the first VR kit I&rsquo;ve found comfortable (especially with glasses on), and the game is loads of fun: you have to head balls to various targets while trying to escape from the Football Improvement Center run by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLaDOS">GLaDOS</a>-like evil AI.</p>

<p>At Story, I listened to — and participated in — <a href="https://twitter.com/roseveleth">Rose Eveleth&rsquo;s</a> interactive <a href="https://www.flashforwardpod.com/">Flash Forward</a>, a podcast about the future. It was a collective choose-your-own-adventure, where we could vote on things at various points of the story. It was a fun experience.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gabyandallison.com">Gaby Dunn&rsquo;s and Allison Raskin&rsquo;s</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/justbetweenusshow/videos">Just Between Us</a> was also fun, a dating advice show this time live on stage. It was really funny.</p>

<p>The evening closed with <a href="https://twitter.com/fraying">Derek Powazek&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://fray.com/index-old.shtml">Fray</a>, a storytelling event, which was pretty much my favorite thing at XOXO 2016. It started at 11, and there must have been at best two dozen people in the auditorium in the front rows. At the time, I listened to a lot of <a href="https://themoth.org/podcast">The Moth</a>, a storytelling podcast, and always dreamed of attending one live, and this was pretty damn close to that. I was tired to my bones, but somehow the stories kept me awake and alert — pretty much all of them were great, though I only remember one by now.</p>

Derek</p>

<p>I kind of wish I had signed up in retrospect — though if my memory serves me right when they announced the signups I didn&rsquo;t really get the whole thing. After I got back to my Airbnb, I recited myself an impromptu story, as I would have told it on stage.</p>

<p>Then I passed out.</p>

<p><a id="Saturday"></a></p>

<h2 id="saturday-conference-day-1-film">Saturday — Conference, Day 1 + Film</h2>

<p>Saturday morning marked the first day of the conference. I got breakfast once again from Fried Eggs I&rsquo;m In Love, then went to the Shark Pizza Donut meetup. That was a codename we came up within the #singles Slack channel, so people would not assume we&rsquo;re there to hit on.</p>

<p>After the meetup, I went to Martha&rsquo;s, a bar within Revolution Hall where talks were livestreamed to for people with festival passes.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5PGxd5a.jpg" alt="Jenn" />
I ran into <a href="https://twitter.com/jennschiffer">Jenn Schiffer</a>, not knowing she is presenting the next day, and really admired her laptop sticker game.</p>

<p>The overarching theme of this XOXO that year was indie makers, money and vulnerability. Highlights from the morning: <a href="https://www.twitter.com/gabydunn">Gaby Dunn</a> <a href="https://xoxofest.com/2016/projects/gaby-dunn">talked about</a> the perils of signing contracts without reading, predatory contracts, trying to make it as a freelancer and being <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bad-with-money-with-gaby-dunn/id1144712710">Bad with Money</a>, a podcast she started just before the festival and since then <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FQVGG7P/">turned into a book</a> as well. <a href="https://www.twitter.com/itsa_talia">Talia Jane</a> <a href="https://xoxofest.com/2016/projects/talia-jane">talked about</a> going viral with <a href="https://medium.com/@taliajane/an-open-letter-to-my-ceo-fb73df021e7a">her letter to Yelp&rsquo;s CEO</a>, a story that surprisingly has a happy ending.</p>

<p>I had lunch with <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanw">Dylan</a> from Slack, who also had adult ADHD. We ended up at a gay bar called Crush near the venue, where I got the coolest sticker for my laptop. I still kick myself for not getting more than one.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1OcuwYz.jpg" alt="sticker" /></p>

<p>Highlights from the afternoon: <a href="https://twitter.com/neilcic">Neil Cicierega</a> <a href="https://xoxofest.com/2016/projects/neil-cicierega">talked about</a> growing up with computers from an early age, going viral and making a ton of things, including mind-bending Smash Mouth-centric mashups (my favorite one is <a href="http://www.neilcic.com/mouthmoods/">Mouth Moods</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WgT9gy4zQA">The Ultimate Showdown</a> which some of you might know. <a href="https://twitter.com/StarleeKine">Starlee Kine</a> is the creator of the <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/mystery-show">Mystery Show</a>, one of the best podcasts ever made, that got unjustly canceled, but she started working on a new episode which you can <a href="https://www.patreon.com/starleekine">support on Patreon</a>. She <a href="https://xoxofest.com/2016/projects/starlee-kine">talked about</a> the creative process and how her show got made.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/johnroderick">John Roderick</a> <a href="https://xoxofest.com/2016/projects/john-roderick">talked about</a> the myth of no effort, being a musician, a podcaster, running for office, mental health issues and important differences between Seattle and Portland. <a href="https://twitter.com/LuBellWoo">Lucy Bellwood</a> who&rsquo;s really into boats <a href="https://xoxofest.com/2016/projects/lucy-bellwood">got really honest</a> about publishing books, and being successful online while not necessarily making a lot of money. She is the creator of <a href="https://lucybellwood.com/100-demon-dialogues/">100 demon dialogues</a>, which you should definitely check out; I even got a demon plushie.</p>

<p>At one point, I managed to spot another person who in my head was a bona fide internet celebrity, one of my internet heroes: Dan Hon. I read his twitter and took his portrait while being starstruck and extremely awkward. Spoilers: two years later we had a great chat at XOXO 2018. If you go to enough XOXOs, you slowly get over the whole celebrity thing.</p>

<p>The evening program was Tabletop and Film; I went by Tabletop at one point but didn&rsquo;t really find anything interesting, so I spent most of my time at Film. I really enjoyed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/everyframeapainting">Every Frame A Painting</a> premiering a new episode, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1xCZ4ODNM2OJuKoBrghDA">Auralnuts</a> being funny and <a href="https://homestarrunner.com/">Homestar Runner&rsquo;s</a> reunion/live show (anyone remembers Strong Bad?)</p>

<p>That was Saturday. I was getting exhausted, but there was still the final day to come.</p>

<p><a id="Sunday"></a></p>

<h2 id="sunday-conference-day-2">Sunday — Conference, Day 2</h2>

<p>In the morning, I went for a run with limited success, then had pancakes for breakfast. After that, I went to Revolution Hall for the final day of the conference.</p>

<p>By the last day of the festival, I was exhausted, mostly emotionally. In the previous days, I <a href="http://facesofxoxo2016.tumblr.com">took a lot of pictures</a> and printed them for people, but I just didn&rsquo;t have it in me on closing day.</p>

<p>I uploaded pictures at Martha&rsquo;s while watching the Conference talks. Some highlights: <a href="https://twitter.com/SimoneGiertz">Simone Giertz</a>, Queen of Shitty robots <a href="https://xoxofest.com/2016/projects/simone-giertz">talked about</a> the importance of building useless things. <a href="https://twitter.com/jennschiffer">Jenn Schiffer</a> <a href="https://xoxofest.com/2016/projects/jenn-schiffer">talked about</a> writing satire on the internet, being on Twitter as a self-described Lady Code Troll and reminded us to never stop talking about Peter Thiel wanting to replace his blood with younger people&rsquo;s blood. <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahjeong">Sarah Jeong</a> <a href="https://xoxofest.com/2016/projects/sarah-jeong">talked about</a> pivoting from lawyer to being a writer, argued for adblockers as someone who works in media, and how she got into reporting on important tech lawsuits.</p>

<p>The closing talk by the Andys was really emotional and raw; very much on-brand for the conference, but I mean it sincerely. I had (and have) a lot of empathy towards these guys who spend an immense amount of time putting this festival together.</p>

<p>The closing party for the evening was at the <a href="https://outpostpdx.com/">XOXO Outpost</a>, a coworking space for indie makers that unfortunately closed down since. I had a vegetarian burrito bowl from a food truck and ice cream from Salt and Straw.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BeVIDA3.jpg" alt="car" />
This was a cool car close to the Outpost.</p>

<p>The surprise musical guest was <a href="https://www.dandeacon.com/">Dan Deacon</a>, and people seemed to be really into him, but it just wasn&rsquo;t my cup of tea. I ended up hanging out with a bunch of people outside the venue. It was around then I ran into one of my other internet heroes, <a href="https://twitter.com/samuelclay">Samuel Clay</a>, who created the RSS reader <a href="http://newsblur.com">NewsBlur</a>; I&rsquo;ve been using that ever since Google Reader got shut down. He was in a sudden need of a place to sleep at, and I managed to convince my Airbnb host to let him crash there.</p>

<p>As a thank you gift, he gave me one of the early prototypes of <a href="https://shop.turntouch.com/">Turn Touch</a>, a wooden smart remote he was working on at the time (and since released).</p>

<p>I left the party somewhat early, feeling completely wiped out. But there would be one more XOXO thing the next day.</p>

<p><a id="Monday"></a></p>

<h2 id="monday-post-festival-pancakes">Monday — Post-Festival Pancakes</h2>

<p>On Monday, I went by a Coinstar machine to convert all the loose change I accumulated over almost a month in the US; I think I got something around $13 in total. I returned my rental camera and then went to <a href="https://www.slappycakes.com/portland">Slappy Cakes</a> for an informal post-XOXO pancake lunch with about two dozen people, including the Andys. It was fun, and I got a hug from Andy McMillan, which meant a lot to me.</p>

<p>And then, XOXO, the festival was over. Until who knows when; the Andys later announced they were taking at least the following year off, and then, who knows. Even before that, they would never commit to another year immediately, but this time we knew there wouldn&rsquo;t be one in 2017.</p>

<p><em>(Of course, now we know that XOXO returned in 2018, after which they explicitly promised it would come back in 2019. But back then, there was a sense of uncertainty.)</em></p>

<p><a id="Reflections"></a></p>

<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>

<p>I feel fortunate that I got to go to XOXO in 2016. It definitely altered the course of my life, and the community became a huge part of my online — and sometimes offline — social life. I know I&rsquo;m not alone in that.</p>

<p>I truly enjoyed my time there, even though I felt this strong emotional numbness/exhaustion, but that&rsquo;s (mostly) not XOXO&rsquo;s fault. It was a byproduct of all the travel weeks before, how I traveled, and how I feel like I failed to set limits when I should have. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about myself on this trip.</p>

<p>XOXO 2016 marked an end of an era for me. About a week after the festival, the thought that I want to leave Sweden and move to Hungary finally made its way from my subconscious into my conscious thoughts. I made the move at the end of the year; it was hard but ultimately worth it.</p>

<p>The festival took place at an interesting time in American politics; just months before the 2016 elections, back when Donald Trump was definitely A Thing but no-one expected him to win.</p>

<p>I credit the festival, the friends I made there and my subsequent presence on the Slack (and all the new people I followed on Twitter) for making me move politically further left and opening my eyes to certain privileges I have. There are a lot of things I still wrestle with; the biggest thing would be the fact that it&rsquo;s an extremely US-centric place. I&rsquo;m not American, and I don&rsquo;t live there (as much as I want to be), so I see and experience a lot of things through a different lens.</p>

<p>I got an idea or two for pet projects after the festival that I never followed through. Still, attending gives you this unique boost in creativity that I value. Someone at XOXO said that when inspiration hits, you have to grab it and run with it. That is something I should do more often, but come to think of it — it&rsquo;s something I already do more often.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made a quite a few friends there, and then more on the Slack afterwards. In 2018, I came back with a mental list of people I wanted to meet, having only talked online.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve said it in the beginning, but it needs to be said again: XOXO sets an incredibly high bar to conferences and festivals with their attention to every single detail and their willingness to listen to community feedback. Once you&rsquo;ve been to an XOXO, you&rsquo;re spoiled forever, and you&rsquo;ll be hard-pressed to find something else that measures up.</p>

<p>Thank you again, Andy, Andy, Rachel and all the volunteers. You&rsquo;ve created something extraordinary.</p>

		<summary>My sister came over last night, and we had a good time. We cooked what we pretty much always cook — fajitas — and watched a movie, as well as started planning a short summer trip to Estonia and Finland. I’ve been there, but she hasn’t, and I like both places, so I’m happy to go with her and show my favorite places there, as well as explore new ones. Right now the plan is to spend a day in Tallinn, at least a day and a half in a nearby national park, then take the ferry to Helsinki and visit the woods near Espoo before heading home.</summary>

<![CDATA[<p>My sister came over last night, and we had a good time. We cooked what we pretty much always cook — fajitas — and watched a movie, as well as started planning a short summer trip to Estonia and Finland. I&rsquo;ve been there, but she hasn&rsquo;t, and I like both places, so I&rsquo;m happy to go with her and show my favorite places there, as well as explore new ones. Right now the plan is to spend a day in Tallinn, at least a day and a half in a nearby national park, then take the ferry to Helsinki and visit the woods near Espoo before heading home.</p>

<hr />

<p>The <a href="https://boringconference.com/">9th Boring Conference</a>&rsquo;s date was just announced (May 4th), and I&rsquo;m definitely going, even though it&rsquo;s about a month after Brexit and who knows what&rsquo;s up by then. I was there last year with a few friends, and we had a blast. It&rsquo;s a day of extremely interesting and fun presentations about seemingly boring topics, and the whole thing costs about 25 GBP or so to attend. I highly recommend it.</p>

<p>A week later there&rsquo;s <a href="http://bangbangcon.com">!!Con</a> in NYC as well. I really want to go, because they have really fun talks, but it&rsquo;s harder to get a ticket, and they release them pretty late, so by the time I would get a ticket it&rsquo;s possible that getting a flight there would be pretty expensive. Plus <a href="https://2018.xoxofest.com/">XOXO</a> is returning for 2019, but it&rsquo;s always a toss if you get in or not with their lottery system for the tickets. Two trips to the US in one year gets expensive pretty quick, so I have to consider my options and do some budgeting.</p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s also <a href="https://itp.nyu.edu/camp2019/">ITP Camp</a> going on in NYC in June, and while timewise I could do it, it&rsquo;s $1400 plus all the costs that come with staying for a month in one of the most expensive cities in the US.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, I&rsquo;d leave early May for Boring, then go to NYC for !!Con, stay for ITP Camp, then meet up in Estonia with my sister before arriving back to Budapest, about two months later. Spend July and August back in Budapest, then come early September I would take another trip to Portland for XOXO for about ten days.</p>

<hr />

<p>It&rsquo;s fun to dream, but doing all of the above would be really expensive, so I&rsquo;ll have to come up with a more realistic plan. I will definitely go to Boring, and XOXO if I get in as well as do the trip with my sister. !!Con is a big question mark, and ITP Camp is, unfortunately, a very likely no.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a good summer, in any case.</p>

		<summary>Here’s a bunch of television I’ve been enjoying recently.
Russian Doll: This was the highlight of recent times: 8 episodes of pure fun, with a proper ending. It’s best watched not knowing anything about it but here are the first five minutes: Nadia leaves her birthday party, and on the way home gets hit by a taxi, and dies.

<![CDATA[<p>Here&rsquo;s a bunch of television I&rsquo;ve been enjoying recently.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80211627">Russian Doll</a>:</strong> This was the highlight of recent times: 8 episodes of pure fun, with a proper ending. It&rsquo;s best watched not knowing anything about it but here are the first five minutes: Nadia leaves her birthday party, and on the way home gets hit by a taxi, and dies. The next moment Nadia is back where the episode started, alive and well, on her own birthday party. It&rsquo;s up on Netflix.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Star_Trek_Discovery_title_card.jpg">Star Trek: Discovery (Season 2)</a>:</strong> I&rsquo;ve only seen three episodes of the new season so far but all of them have been great and I very much like this new take on Star Trek. The fact that it&rsquo;s a prequel to The Original Series bothers me, though, because they could have had a lot more creative freedom and do less retconning if it would be set in another universe. It&rsquo;s also up on Netflix or CBS All Access if you&rsquo;re in the US.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna_(TV_series)">Hanna (pilot)</a></strong>: This is based on the excellent <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993842/">movie of the same name</a>. Hanna is raised in the forest by his father in isolation, training her to be self-sufficient and strong, because someone in the CIA is hunting them for Reasons we don&rsquo;t know yet. The pilot shows a lot of promise, but we&rsquo;ll have to wait until March to see the rest. It&rsquo;s up on Amazon Prime Video.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_Back_(TV_series)">Strike Back (Season 5)</a></strong>: A big, dumb action series about Section 20, a black ops group of MI6, saving the world, or at least parts of it. The writers&rsquo; contract mandated at least two machine-gun fights per episode. It&rsquo;s&hellip; okay at best, I won&rsquo;t be watching Season 6.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpart_(TV_series)">Counterpart (Season 2)</a></strong>: Just before the end of the Cold War, scientists in East Germany discovered a parallel universe, a clone of theirs. In present day, Howard is working as a low-level bureucrat at the UN, overseeing the connection between those worlds, too low on the food chain to know what his actual work is about. Until one day, his &ldquo;other&rdquo; shows up, demanding to speak with him&hellip;<br />
Season 2 has one episode left but so far the series shows no signs of getting boring or tired. Highly recommended.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Place">The Good Place (Season 3)</a></strong>: This has been quite a ride, huh? The first part of the season is a bit disorganized but it gets better as they go along and boy did they put on hell of a season finale. Can&rsquo;t wait for Season 4. If you haven&rsquo;t seen this series, check it out and don&rsquo;t read anything about it, because spoilers can ruin at least half the fun. Should be up on Netflix in Europe.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Punisher_(TV_series)">The Punisher (Season 2)</a></strong>: I loved the first season, but I quit this season after four episodes. The antagonist of Season 2 is just really, really bad. If you can get past that, it&rsquo;s on Netflix.</p>

<p>What have you been watching lately?</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/02/14/on-excercise/">written about</a> my relationship with exercise, but I left out a significant bit: yoga.</p>

<p>Growing up fundamentalist, you learn that yoga (and most martial arts) are <em>Bad</em>. It&rsquo;s by the devil; you&rsquo;re worshiping other Gods, and so on. Even though I&rsquo;ve been working hard to get rid of these parts of my faith, it&rsquo;s a slow and arduous process.</p>

<p>So I never even thought of trying it for a long time. Then a former coworker and friend got into it; time to time she&rsquo;d say &ldquo;You should really give yoga a try,&rdquo; and I would be like yeah, maybe, someday. Putting aside old and harmful beliefs, it also looked just&hellip; boring.</p>

<hr />

<p>In late 2014 I broke my leg. Recovery was slow and painful, even though I did a decent amount of physical therapy. One day I stumbled upon a mass yoga event on Facebook and for whatever reason, I thought &ldquo;eh, okay, why not?&rdquo; So I went. It was awkward, unusual and weird, but I distinctly remember that afterwards the pain from my leg just disappeared for two days, like a miracle.</p>

<p>Even that was not enough at the time to start a regular practice, but in the spring of 2016, I finally pulled the trigger. I didn&rsquo;t even know how to breathe right on the first class (hint: use only your nose), but it felt amazing, especially after the class. So I kept going back, as much as I could, though I was traveling a lot during that time.</p>

<p>Yoga made me at least a bit more flexible, but more importantly, it helped me to slow down, and it gave me space to process things. My mind would often wander during class, and while that&rsquo;s somewhat discouraged, it was exactly what I needed at that time. And more often than not I would leave calmer and feeling more at peace with myself, something I desperately needed.</p>

<p>I was spoiled by having a great class filled with other expats and <a href="http://www.unfoldyourmat.com/">my awesome teacher, Lavinia</a>. For her regular drop-in classes I&rsquo;ve visited, she has her own style, a mix of existing ones, that has evolved over the recent years.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mVKUk8V.jpg" alt="Lavinia and I" />  </center>
<center>Me and my teacher</center></p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t done much yoga since I left Sweden. I&rsquo;ve searched and tried, but I haven&rsquo;t found a good class/teacher that I was happy with long-term—like I said, I was really spoiled, and it set the bar high. And maybe it&rsquo;s not what I need right now.</p>

<p>To this day though, whenever I visit Gothenburg, I make it a point to go to at least one of her classes, and they never fail to disappoint me. In an ideal world, I would be able to teleport to Sweden once a week for a 90-minute class.</p>

<p>I can only tell you what my friend kept telling me: you should really give yoga a try.</p>

<![CDATA[<h2 id="facts">Facts</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a few facts. I&rsquo;m fat. I&rsquo;m 174 (5&rsquo;7&rdquo;) and I weight about 125 kilos (275 pounds). I&rsquo;ve had high blood pressure for the last 15 years or so, though the causes of that are complex. My cholesterol is officially considered high as of a few months ago, and if I don&rsquo;t do something about it, I&rsquo;ll have to start taking meds for it.</p>

<p>A huge part of it is likely genetics; men on my father&rsquo;s side are historically overweight. But my terrible eating schedule (or the lack of thereof) and compulsive snacking does not help either.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go into my diet too much, because that&rsquo;s material for another post; in any case, it&rsquo;s a fact that exercise is something I definitely need.</p>

<h2 id="traumas">Traumas</h2>

<p>I have a messy relationship with working out and exercise in general. I was a chubby kid who was bullied growing up and I sucked at gym class. Having shitty teachers didn&rsquo;t help either. So what I quickly learned is to just give up. Had to run laps for a few minutes, and I&rsquo;m out of breath after 20 seconds? Just walk the rest of the way. The teacher will yell at you, classmates will make fun of you, but <em>whatever</em>. It&rsquo;s the least bad option.</p>

<p>In high school, I got lucky and got transferred to the special gym class, for kids with mild disabilities, motor issues and such. It was easier: only two classes a week, and one of them was swimming. Which I am not great at, but not the worst either. Even there, I mostly just gave up on things quickly, but there was a lot less bullying and judging going around.</p>

<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>

<p>After I was finished with school, I more or less stopped thinking of or worrying about exercise and didn&rsquo;t do much for almost ten years. There were times when I&rsquo;d go swimming for a couple times before I would get bored with it (I still do). There were short periods when I was biking instead of taking the public transport, but they never lasted. When I broke my leg in 2014, I did do a decent amount of physical therapy, but I half-assed even that somewhat. To this day, my right leg, the one that was broken is still a bit weaker. I would go to the gym irregularly after that, mostly doing 20-30 minutes on the elliptical machine. I kind of wanted to exercise, but a huge part of me was fighting against it mentally.</p>

<p>Then one day, about three years ago, while being stuck in a nasty loop of self-pity, a friend of mine miraculously got me to (somewhat) snap out of it by getting me to sign up for a military boot camp-style workout program. We made a deal: I would go 10 times, and I can stop after that if I wanted to.</p>

<p>I ended up going only six times, and I hated most of it, except for one part: running.</p>

<h2 id="running">Running</h2>

<p>One of the reasons I never considered running before was that it felt like the most boring thing ever; about as dull as swimming, if not more. That, and all the bad experiences in gym class growing up. But I had this strange urge to do it anyway.</p>

<p>When I started it was still very much winter, so I went to a sports store, got a bunch of warm running clothes, downloaded Runkeeper on my phone and then I just&hellip; ran.</p>

<p>I quickly realized that the only way I can do this is running intervals; that is, running a while, then walking a while, then running a while and so on. Runkeeper has a nifty feature where you can set up custom intervals; most of the time I tried to stick to 90 seconds of running and 60 seconds of walking.</p>

<p>I never had much of a running schedule. I would have phases; I would go for a run three times in one week, then skip the next two weeks. As I&rsquo;ve mentioned it earlier, it was a constant fight with myself. Part of me felt this urge to go for a run almost every day, but another part of me was actively fighting against it. I know this is a common experience; it&rsquo;s one that didn&rsquo;t really change over the years, though.</p>

<hr />

<p>Mostly eschewing &ldquo;real&rdquo; races, I was racing myself, trying to improve my pace. My dream was running a 5K in 30 minutes, which is a 6:00 pace average (the best I ever did was about 4K with 6:46 on a treadmill). I ran both outside and inside; each has pros and cons. Being outside gives you variety and makes things less boring; however, on a treadmill I can set a pace and push myself more.</p>

<p>I did find one race that I kept going back to called <a href="https://www.morfitrun.com/szigetrun">Sziget Run</a> a monthly timed 5K at Margaret&rsquo;s Island in Budapest, a popular running place. There is a bit of a community around it, and the organizers are great. It became this fixed thing in my life: once a month I would get up early, and do a 5K with a bunch of people. Most of the time I would finish dead last, but everyone was always a good sport about it, cheering me on.</p>

<p>One thing on my bucket list was doing a complete lap around Central Park, which I was fortunate enough to do when I went for a trip to NY in late 2016. It was literally one of the first things I did there. My pace was terrible, and I felt like I was dying towards the end but I did it, and I&rsquo;m still proud of it. The next day I would run an even longer distance around Williamsburg.</p>

<p>The longest run I did was last summer: it was a 12K race I signed up for. I first signed up for the 6K, then changed my mind in the last minute, thinking 6K is not much of a challenge, but I never did 12K, so why not? I finished last and my body was not happy with me afterwards, but I&rsquo;m glad I did it.</p>

<hr />

<p>I very seldom got what people call &ldquo;runner&rsquo;s high&rdquo;, but for a long time, I did feel much better after a good run. It was a challenge to get started, hell, it was a challenge to keep going but in the end, I would be rewarded with those sweet, sweet endorphins. Until I wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Around 2018 I was going through a time when I was pretty depressed, and running slowly started being less and less enjoyable. One could make the argument that exercise is not about enjoying it, but I digress; you need to get at least some form of satisfaction from it to keep going. And what kept happening was that I would go for a run, and come away feeling just as bad or even worse after it.</p>

<p>Last fall, when I was at XOXO 2018 I co-organized two morning runs that were quite popular. I&rsquo;m happy that I did that; at the same time, it was the last time I would go for a run, at least for a while.</p>

<h2 id="this-story-is-not-over">This story is not over</h2>

<p>I was going through some old diary entries late last year and I noticed a pattern: every 3 months or so, I would make myself a note: get a personal trainer. For years. So last month, after not doing any form of exercise since September or so, I did just that, with the goal of working out thrice a week.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only been 6 times so far, because I had to skip almost 2 weeks as I got sick, but so far, so good. We mostly do weights and some cardio, though yesterday we did a session with mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training">HIIT</a>. I have mixed feelings about it, we&rsquo;ll see how it works out in the long run.</p>

<p>My personal trainer and I talked about going running once the weather gets better, so who knows, I might pick it up again. For now, my goal is to do a solid hour of workout and hope that I feel at least somewhat better after. I&rsquo;m not there yet, but I don&rsquo;t hate it either, so the jury&rsquo;s still out.</p>

<p>In any case, I&rsquo;ll keep going.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>My father is a semi-amateur photographer; I got my affinity towards photography from him. I grew up watching him taking pictures. After high school, I got a job and soon I had disposable income, so I got my first digital camera: the <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/olympuse1">Olympus E-1</a>.</p>

<p>That was in 2008, and by then, it was already outdated. Released in 2003, it had a first-generation micro <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> sensor, 5 megapixels and ISO 800 was barely usable. That didn&rsquo;t stop me; it was a camera I was familiar with because my father had one for years. I frequently borrowed my dad&rsquo;s excellent <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/products/olympus/lenses/oly_14-54_2p8-3p5">14-54mm f/2.8-3.5</a> which is still one of the best glasses ever made. The combination of the lens and the camera took good pictures, ones that look great even in 2019.</p>

<p>In those early days I photographed a lot of things, but after a while I kind realized that I mostly like shooting people and that&rsquo;s where my passion&rsquo;s at. Portraits, parties, events, families and so on.</p>

<hr />

<p>The first phone I owned that could take pictures was the Blackberry 9000 (I still miss that keyboard&hellip;). The image quality was pretty bad by today&rsquo;s standards, but it was a start. After that, I had two Android phones; they were a bit better, but still not great. The first phone with a decent camera arrived to me in 2013 in the form of an iPhone 4S, and I was a convert. I took a lot of photos in the next few years with it and the other iPhones I eventually upgraded to (a 5S, then a 6+ then back to the 5S). People were still my focus, but I also took a lot of random pictures for social media. The 5S was surprisingly capable of capturing a good sunset.</p>

<hr />

<p>I started playing with film photography around 2010, borrowing my dad&rsquo;s <a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Contax_137_MD">Contax SLR</a> collecting dust. I bought a roll of black and white film for it and started shooting with a <a href="https://phillipreeve.net/blog/review-carl-zeiss-planar-1450-cy/">Zeiss 50mm f/1.4 lens</a>. Later on, I&rsquo;d get a <a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Canon_Canonet_QL_17_/_QL_19_/_QL_25">Canonet QL19 rangefinder</a>, and shot a few rolls with that. I gave that one away to a friend, something I kind of regret. Then again, getting a new one wouldn&rsquo;t cost too much. I took some of my best photos to this day on film and I almost always shot black and white, there was just something to it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Shooting with an analog SLR spoils you with that big, beautiful viewfinder. I became obsessed with getting a full-frame DSLR, which were not quite affordable until Canon released the 6D and Nikon the D600 around 2012. It took me a couple of years, but at the end of 2013 I was finally able to afford one. I got the 6D and eventually two lenses for it: the 40mm f/2.8 pancake and the 85mm f/1.8, the latter being my favorite lens to this day: it&rsquo;s razor-sharp and takes the best portraits. I got a flash for it as well, and it sort of became my &ldquo;work&rdquo; camera. I got into party photography and became really good at dancing with a heavy DSLR in one hand. I even got paid for it sometimes.</p>

<hr />

<p>From the earliest days, I shot in RAW and used Lightroom Classic (née Lightroom). By now my brain is hardwired for it. I have a good workflow, and I can edit the 800 pictures I took on a party down to about 60 good ones in 2-3 hours.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the middle of 2015 and I was about to leave for a couple of months of work and travel in Southern Europe. I didn&rsquo;t want to lug my heavy 6D around, but I felt that having only a phone was not enough. It was a perfect excuse for me to finally buy a Fuji X-E1. By then I was already infected with a fascination with Fuji&rsquo;s mirrorless cameras because one of my former best friends was really into them. I got two lenses for it, the 35mm f/1.4 and the 18-55 f/2.8-4. The autofocus and the EVF sucks, but it makes the most beautiful black and white JPEGs. They have a certain kind of magic to them.</p>

<p>I used it with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye-Fi">Eye-Fi card</a> I got a few months prior, an SD card with built-in WiFi that sends all the pictures you take to your phone. Combining that with my instant printers (Fuji Instax Share SP-2, Paperang P1), I could take DSLR-quality portraits of people and hand it to them printed out two minutes later. It never fails to amaze.</p>

<hr />

<p>By 2018 my enthusiasm for photography has started to dwindle. I was still talking random snapshots with my aging 5S, but I stopped carrying my Fuji with me in my backpack. I also stopped going to the kind of parties where I&rsquo;d take pictures. I got myself a Pixel 2 to finally upgrade my phone, which briefly got me interested in photography again, and later on, I switched to an iPhone X, which I used for a <a href="http://facesofxoxo2018.tumblr.com">series of portraits</a> (and instant pictures) on XOXO 2018.</p>

<hr />

<p>Nowadays most of my equipment is collecting dust. My creativity gets channeled into other things: <a href="https://instagram.com/ktamasart">drawing</a> and <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com">writing</a>. I think part of the reason I stopped doing photography is that it can create a distance between you and whatever you&rsquo;re taking pictures. Without my camera, I am often more present.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the future will bring, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if eventually I&rsquo;d start taking more pictures again.</p>

<hr />

<![CDATA[<p>I signed the new contract for my apartment a couple days ago. There has been a change: my youngest sister is moving in with her boyfriend, so one of my friends is taking her place.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll miss my sister. We get along well and enjoy each other&rsquo;s company. In practice, she&rsquo;s been gone for more, than six months now: spending the majority of her time at her boyfriend&rsquo;s place and coming home for only a couple days a month. I&rsquo;m happy for her, but I still miss her. So I&rsquo;ve been living alone for a while now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve lived alone on and off during the last decade or so. I&rsquo;ve been privileged enough to be able to pick my flatmates. I have an aversion of living with strangers, so I always picked people I know, friends or at least acquaintances.</p>

<p>Of course, just because you know the person moving in with you, does not mean you know how it&rsquo;s like to actually live with them. I got lucky with that as well so far; all my flatmates were great, and we got along well. I&rsquo;m hoping for the same with my new one.</p>

<p>I could have looked for another place to live when I got the news from my sister, but this is one of the best apartments I&rsquo;ve had so far. It&rsquo;s the right size, it has a big kitchen with a gas stove and a lot of working area, there&rsquo;s a decent amount of natural light and most importantly, it has AC — something that&rsquo;s rare in Hungary — for the humid 35°C (95°F) summers we have in Budapest. There are two big, separate rooms, perfect for two people. It would be nice to have an additional living room, but still, I really can&rsquo;t complain. And it&rsquo;s affordable, especially for the area it&rsquo;s in: the rent is 440€, with the total being around 490-520€ per month, the latter including utilities and Internet. All of that gets divided between two people, of course.</p>

<p>The location is excellent, well-connected, with major metro and tram lines closeby. It&rsquo;s not quite in the heart of Budapest, but everything is still pretty close.</p>

<p><em>(I feel like I&rsquo;m writing an ad for the apartment here, but no, you can&rsquo;t have it.)</em></p>

<hr />

<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take me a while to adjust to living with someone again, but I&rsquo;m hoping for the best.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I got sucked into &ldquo;real&rdquo; board games about a decade ago. Some of my <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/01/19/the-as-of-yet-unwritten-oral-history-of-turulcsirip-an-early-twitter-client-and-community/">newfound friends from Twitter</a> were into them, so we got together one night and started playing <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13/catan">Catan</a>, the gateway drug to the board game world.</p>

<p>Catan isn&rsquo;t bad, per se; it&rsquo;s just there are so many games that are much better than it, so we moved on to other games. After my move to Sweden, for a couple of years, I didn&rsquo;t have too many friends to play with. In my last year there I&rsquo;ve found a board gaming group and played regularly with them for a while, discovering many new games and making new friends. Since I moved back to Hungary, I haven&rsquo;t played much but I want to change that this year.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here&rsquo;s a non-exhaustive list of games I enjoyed over the years and still enjoy many of them:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28143/race-galaxy">Race for the Galaxy</a> (and its expansions):</strong> A card game, in which you&rsquo;re each building your own galactic civilization, with different planets, goods, capabilities and so on. It took years of regular play to finally get bored with it; it&rsquo;s that good. The mechanics are not complicated, but it does have a learning curve. We tried teaching it to a lot of people over the years, and it was interesting to see how fast some people learned, while others kept struggling with it and never really got a hang of it. While luck does play a role in it, the better you get at it, the less it matters. The base game doesn&rsquo;t have much interaction between the players — whoever had the most points at the end of the game, wins — but the expansions do add some.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3955/bang">Bang</a>:</strong> A spaghetti western in a card game. Each player takes one of the four distinct roles: Sheriff, Deputy, Outlaw or Renegade. The Sheriff and their Deputies want the Outlaws and the Renegade dead, the Outlaws want to kill the Sheriff and the Renegade wants to be the last person standing. Only the Sheriff&rsquo;s role is known, it&rsquo;s up to you to guess who&rsquo;s playing who. Spoilers: everyone will keep insisting they&rsquo;re the Deputy.<br />
You shoot at each other, dodge bullets, hide behind barrels, drink beer to get back life points&hellip; It has quite a bit of luck in it, but that never gets in the way of having fun, and you can play it with up to 8 people.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola">Agricola</a>:</strong> You&rsquo;re a farmer with a spouse, and you&rsquo;re building your own farm, through 14 distinct rounds. You sow and reap crops, build fences, buy animals, expand your house and your family throughout the game. Like Race for the Galaxy, it&rsquo;s kind of a multiplayer solitaire, but it&rsquo;s a lot of fun. The only downside of it is that it takes about 15 minutes or so to set it up and even more to pack things away.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129622/love-letter">Love Letter</a>:</strong> Best played with 4 players, this game consists of only 16 cards and a bunch of heart tokens. You&rsquo;re a young lover, trying to win the affection of the princess. There are 8 different kinds of cards in the small deck and the game is mostly about being able to correctly guess who has which cards. It has quick, 5-10 minute rounds, so you usually play a bunch of them.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames">Codenames</a></strong>: This is the best party game, hands down. Two teams are working on finding their picks on a 5x5 grid of words. Each side has one Codemaster, who knows which words belong to their group and wants them to guess right: the only thing they can say is a one-word clue and a number. So if the table has &ldquo;Athens,&rdquo; &ldquo;Berlin&rdquo; and &ldquo;France,&rdquo; and all those cards belong to their team, they can say &ldquo;Europe, 3&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s that simple, and yet this was an easy and unlikely example; more often than not you&rsquo;re lucky if you can connect two words. Best played with 6-10 people. It&rsquo;s been translated to a bazillion languages there&rsquo;s even one where you have drawing instead of words.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/223327/someone-has-died">Someone Has Died</a></strong>: I played this game at XOXO 2018 and fell in love with it within minutes. It&rsquo;s an improvisation storytelling card game: one person takes the role of the Estate Keeper, who the rest of the players will have to convince that they deserve all that money the recently deceased had. Everyone gets a role, a relationship to the deceased and two story cards. In the first round, you proceed with your introduction, weaving your cards into the your story. It has four distinct rounds, and the winner is the person who is deemed to have been the most convincing by the Estate Keeper. If storytelling games are your thing, you&rsquo;re gonna have loads of fun with this one.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133473/sushi-go">Sushi Go!</a>:</strong> This is a draft-and pass game: you deal a certain amount of cards, pick one and pass your hand to the next person until they&rsquo;re all on the table. It&rsquo;s fast, and it&rsquo;s fun: each card has a type of sushi and a given amount of points; many of them only give you points when you have more than one of them, or combine them in a particular order. Best of all, the graphics are really cute. There&rsquo;s a new version, called <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/192291/sushi-go-party">Sushi Go Party!</a> with even more cards and support for up to 8 players (the original only goes up to 5).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/107529/kingdom-builder">Kingdom Builder</a>:</strong> One of the most versatile board games I&rsquo;ve ever played. You have a board, made of hexagons, which you build out of four randomly picked tiles. Your primary objective is to build settlements and build your kingdom. However, the three ways of getting points are drawn from a deck and therefore each game requires wildly different strategies.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic">Pandemic</a>:</strong> A co-op eurogame in which you work together with everyone against the game itself, to stop a global pandemic killing humanity. Each player gets role with distinct powers. It&rsquo;s fun and it can be quite challenging as well; the game lets you pick the difficulty.<br />
You can&rsquo;t talk about Pandemic without mentioning <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161936/pandemic-legacy-season-1">Pandemic Legacy</a>, a version of the game in which you play 12 to 24 games total, while the game changes in permanent ways. You name viruses, you tear up cards and so on. This requires you to have a regular, dedicated group of friends, but if you have those, it&rsquo;s heaps of fun, I&rsquo;ve been told. There are even two seasons of it out by now.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181279/fury-dracula-thirdfourth-edition">Fury of Dracula</a>:</strong> <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/438/scotland-yard">Scotland Yard</a> on steroids. One player takes the role of Dracula, moving around in Europe invisibly and building up an army of vampires, while everyone else is hunting him. Working against the clock, you have to be wise and try to find and defeat him. It&rsquo;s a bit long (about 2-3 hours), but don&rsquo;t let that deter you.</li>
</ul>

<![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m a freelancer; I don&rsquo;t have an office. I can&rsquo;t work from home; the silence is deafening, I need the background noise, and I need to be among people. The place I work from every day is a café about 25 minutes from my home; it&rsquo;s called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/flowcoffeeandbistro/">Flow</a>. I am a person of habit: I wake up, I get dressed, I go to Flow and start working.</p>

<p>Flow is one of the many, many specialty cafés in Budapest. Don&rsquo;t ask me about their coffee: I mostly eschew caffeine — <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/02/02/re-take-your-pills-my-story-of-adhd/">my ADHD meds</a> mostly replace caffeine — so my regular drink is an iced decaf latte with oat milk. It&rsquo;s one of the most pointless drinks ever, but I like it.</p>

<p>So I don&rsquo;t go to Flow for their coffee, but for everything else. It&rsquo;s big; ceilings about 5 meters high and plenty of space, unlike most cafés. They have fresh pastries delivered every morning; if I get there early enough, I can nab one of my favorite chocolate rolls. And I kinda know some of the people running the place. They used to have great wifi as well, until the people responsible for it installed a network filter on it, blocking random sites and making work impossible. Thank God for unlimited 4G and tethering. They&rsquo;re vegan, and I&rsquo;m a carnivore, but they do have delicious tapioca pudding desserts. That, and plenty of power outlets.</p>

<p>Before Flow, I had another café as my base; before that place, another. I tried coworking spaces, and I was even part of one for about 6 months before the community around it started to dwindle.</p>

<hr />

<p>On weekends or where I&rsquo;m traveling, I go to a Starbucks. They usually have decent wifi, and their decaf is the same everywhere. They&rsquo;re ubiquitous; you can find many of them in most major western cities these days (except for Sweden; there, I&rsquo;ll go to an Espresso House instead).</p>

<hr />

<p>Working from cafés is in many ways is not ideal, but it&rsquo;s the thing that works for me. What <em>would be</em> ideal is a proper office, with coworkers — but I can&rsquo;t give up freelancing for so many reasons. And it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m alone here; I get to hang out with other friends who work remotely.</p>

<p>So cafés it is.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I started University last fall, and I used that as an excuse to get a 2018 iPad and an Apple Pencil. I had to take notes, after all, and why not do it digitally? The university thing didn&rsquo;t last, but something else happened after a month or so: I started drawing.</p>

<hr />

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t that into drawing as a kid. Sure, I doodled just like everyone else, especially at a young age, and I do remember doing at least one pastel drawing, but that was about it. Hell, I was not much into visual arts either, or so it feels like, with the notable exception of photography. So it surprised even myself when one day, on a whim, I paid $10 for Procreate and promptly spent the next few days glued to my iPad and drawing every waking minute of the day.</p>

<p>A few months before that, <a href="https://facesofxoxo2018.tumblr.com/">I did a series of portraits</a> at XOXO 2018 and they felt like a natural starting point. I started tracing these photos; open them in Procreate, set the opacity to around 50% or so, create a new layer, pick up my virtual graphite pencil and start drawing over them. I think I did about a dozen of these; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BonAsl3Ab18/">you</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BooYFCoAPIs/">can</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BorP2uBAfze/">find</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bot2On1iq3R/">some</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BoxAg_gChRj/">of</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BozvU_NAlbn/">them</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bo460bQAE0h/">on</a> <a href="https://instagram.com/ktamasenty">my Instagram</a>.  Looking at them months later, I think they don&rsquo;t look too bad for a newbie.</p>

<p>Tracing felt like cheating — even though I know it&rsquo;s not — and the next step was to find something or someone to draw.  I was already aware of a place in Budapest called <a href="https://www.painterspalace.eu/">Painters Palace</a>, a great art community that has weekly figure drawing classes. It&rsquo;s full of amazing people, and they have a fantastic space.</p>

<p>I fell in love with figure drawing the very first time I did it. Drawing the naked human body is may not be the easiest thing, but it&rsquo;s loads of fun. It didn&rsquo;t take me long before I started modeling as well; I did it twice so far, and I plan to do it more in the future. My Instagram has a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BpDQN_cAj0R/">few early drawings</a> posted, and I started posting my huge backlog to my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ktamasart">art account</a>.</p>

<p>Another thing I started doing was drawing hands from reference images. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BtG1QNQj3JB/">I have</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BtI7WwyAdhj/">a couple</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BtL7W7EA7yn/">of these</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BtbDYBIgrmS/">published</a> so far with at least one more to come.</p>

<hr />

<p>There is some irony in the fact that even though I do almost all my drawing digitally, I use pencil and charcoal and I&rsquo;m consciously trying to make them look like analog drawings. That being said, I don&rsquo;t have much desire to use &ldquo;real&rdquo; pencil and paper, at least not right now.</p>

<p>All in all, it&rsquo;s a great outlet for creativity and I&rsquo;m very happy I discovered it.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I was going to finally get back to work on my latest series before I distracted myself with other things, like tweaking <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com">my blog</a> (word counts! reading time! endlessly tweaking the CSS!) as well as continuing to cross-post some of my writings from here. One thing I noticed is how my writing has improved over the last month (at least in my opinion). I was also mildly horrified how bad my spelling and grammar was before I started using Grammarly. Through this process, I fixed many early mistakes in those posts, though I don&rsquo;t think I will edit them much beyond that.</p>

<p><em>A few days ago I bit the bullet and subscribed to Grammarly Premium, which fixes commas, sometimes tenses and other things one might mess up. It&rsquo;s not a magic bullet, and I often disagree with its recommendations, but overall it&rsquo;s definitely worth the money for me. If you want to save 40% on your subscription, register a new account and simply wait a few days. They will email you a discount on your first year.</em></p>

<p>I also took the opportunity to edit my series about ADHD into <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/02/02/re-take-your-pills-my-story-of-adhd/">one big longread</a>. It made me realize that breaking things down into smaller chunks really helps with writing, but at the same time editing them into one long article is not an easy process and I still suck at it. This is something I want to get better at as I want to write more long-form articles.</p>

<hr />

<p>About ten years ago, before social media really blew up and blogs were all the rage, I hated when people <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=metablogging">metablogged</a>. A lot has changed, of course, but I can&rsquo;t help but see the irony that right now I&rsquo;m doing pretty much the same thing: writing about writing, for me a form of progressive procrastination and a way to hit that 300-word mark and keep my streak.</p>

<p>In 2019 I feel like it&rsquo;s allright, as long as it&rsquo;s not overdone. I better find something else to write about for tomorrow, though.</p>

<p><em>This post was</em> <strong><em>not</em></strong> <em>sponsored by Grammarly, even though I&rsquo;ve written about them plenty of times now, so they should really consider doing that.</em></p>

<![CDATA[<p>Owen <a href="https://writetogether.space/posts/owen/take-your-pills">wrote about his journey with AD(H)D</a> and I figured I could tell my story as well, especially since no two AD(H)D stories are the same.</p>

<p><em>A note on terminology: I use ADHD, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders">DSM-IV</a> and up uses ADHD as well, with a note that not everyone is &ldquo;H.&rdquo; Instead, it has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#Subtypes">subtypes</a>: ADHD-PI, ADHD-PH and ADHD-C, but even these names have alternatives. Naming things is difficult, y&rsquo;all.</em></p>

<h3 id="in-the-beginning">In the beginning&hellip;</h3>

<p>I was what they call a &ldquo;problem child&rdquo;. From kindergarten, I had poor social skills: I would get bullied a lot, and I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of friends either. The first 8 years I attended a grand total of 5 different schools, which didn&rsquo;t help either, neither did the fact that I was fired from the penultimate one for said lack of social skills and my old school did not take me back for the same reason. I&rsquo;ve spent most of the last 3 years homeschooled, and by homeschooled I mean being home mostly by myself, learning the material on my own and having tests at the end of each semester to get grades. I was a smart kid as well, and while I&rsquo;d like to think I wasn&rsquo;t too obnoxious about it, I&rsquo;m sure that didn&rsquo;t help, either.</p>

<p><em>(the homeschooling thing is a whole &lsquo;nother story which I&rsquo;ll not go into it here, but let me just say, it was, in some ways, genuinely helpful for me)</em></p>

<p>My parents were not great at handling all this. They saw something was wrong early on, but couldn&rsquo;t for the life of them figure out what exactly, and how to fix it, so in many ways, they just made things worse. I was raised in a fairly strict fundamentalist Christian household, so they&rsquo;d mostly respond with various forms of punishment, and yes that included corporal.</p>

<p>We have to take a small detour here: besides my ADHD, I&rsquo;ve had undiagnosed anxiety issues and OCD as well. When most people hear OCD, they think of the shit you see in the movies: people closing the door precisely six times, obsessively cleaning things, etc. While there are cases that are like that, a lot, I repeat, a lot of people live with OCD where it mostly happens in their head. For me, that manifested in a lot of crazy irrational fears going around in my head on loop <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> and a sense of helplessness of me not being able to counter them. My OCD wouldn&rsquo;t get diagnosed until well into adulthood; I might write more on it later.</p>

<h3 id="getting-diagnosed">Getting diagnosed</h3>

<p>This detour is crucial because ultimately my OCD was what lead to a huge meltdown I had when I was 12. I was <em>out of it</em> for days, full of crazy fears (another story for another day) and my parents did not handle that too well either. After a few days, they took me to an inpatient psychiatric clinic, which was a pretty traumatic experience (once again, another story for another day) but they did finally diagnose me with ADHD and gave me medication for it (Ritalin IR 10mg, once or twice a day, can&rsquo;t quite remember). After this, I became homeschooled for the rest of elementary school (see above). My parents say I improved with medication.</p>

<p>I went back to attending school in grade 9 for four years of high school. The first year was hell; I still had no social skills and still got bullied a lot. But something started to change in the second year, and by the end of that I had a group of friends, reasonable social skills,  wasn&rsquo;t bullied too much anymore, and the last two years of high school is something I genuinely enjoyed.</p>

<p>Around the age of 16 or so, to the recommendation of my psychiatrist, my parents stopped giving me medication. My parents claim they switched to placebo and didn&rsquo;t notice a difference; to be fair, neither did I at the time. They said I &ldquo;grew out of it,&rdquo; which was a popular notion at the time. You also have to keep in mind that ADHD medication, research and pretty much everything usually lags at least 10-15 years behind the US in Hungary (and to a certain degree, in Europe). We know better, nowadays, that a lot of ADHD kids don&rsquo;t &ldquo;grow out of it&rdquo; and struggle through adulthood.</p>

<hr />

<p>I worked as a journalist through high school and started freelancing with a translation agency as well, who hired me full-time after my graduation.</p>

<p>Things went mostly well for the first few years; everything was new, and novelty is a huge motivational factor for ADHD. Working in the same office together with people is helpful too, not to mention deadlines. They did let me be a generalist and work at my own pace when client work was not involved. This was both a blessing and a curse; I didn&rsquo;t feel any unnecessary pressure, but in hindsight, I procrastinated a lot and beat myself up for it (I still do). I don&rsquo;t subscribe to the cult and fetishization of productivity, but that&rsquo;s a fact. A bit of nudge from someone goes a long way. I was suffering in a lot of different ways as well; I&rsquo;ll get back to these things later in this article.</p>

<h3 id="getting-rediagnosed">Getting rediagnosed</h3>

<p>I was 21 when somehow, I genuinely don&rsquo;t remember how, I stumbled upon a book that&rsquo;d change my life: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003719FSW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">You Mean I&rsquo;m Not Lazy, Stupid or Crazy?!: The Classic Self-Help Book for Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder</a>. I read it, and I immediately knew, I still had ADHD.</p>

<p>I went through a long and arduous process of being rediagnosed, not unlike the one <a href="https://writetogether.space/posts/owen/take-your-pills">Owen describes</a>, so I&rsquo;ll skip the description of the process. For me it took weeks, and it kinda sucked, but in the end, I got my diagnosis and started medication once again. Ritalin IR, 10mg, twice a day.</p>

<hr />

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a break here and talk more about ADHD itself and how it feels for me. Strap in; this might take a while.</p>

<h3 id="talking-about-adhd-and-what-is-it-anyway">Talking about ADHD and what is it anyway?</h3>

<p>Let me start by saying that it&rsquo;s hard to talk to people about your ADHD and its symptoms. <em>A lot</em> of people will brush it or its symptoms off with things like &ldquo;oh yeah I procrastinate too,&rdquo; &ldquo;yeah sometimes I forget where my keys are&rdquo; or &ldquo;yeah I can&rsquo;t motivate myself to do boring things.&rdquo; I could go on.</p>

<p>ADHD is not about whether you procrastinate, forget your keys, or have a hard time doing boring things, among other things. To get a diagnosis, you have to meet a certain set of criteria, and they have to do with a lot of different things and <em>more importantly, the severity of them</em>. That is what most people don&rsquo;t realize when they say things like the ones I listed above. You can find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders">DSM-V</a>&rsquo;s fairly good criteria listed <a href="https://www.addrc.org/dsm-5-criteria-for-adhd/">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>I will explicitly not go into the &ldquo;is ADHD being overdiagnosed/are our kids being overmedicated&rdquo; debate — that&rsquo;d be an entire post in itself.</em></p>

<p>ADHD is the utter, extremely frustrating inability to focus on something that you consciously wants to. Your brain, through a variety of factors, decides what to focus on by itself and you have very limited say in that. This is one of the reasons Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder is a terrible name: I don&rsquo;t have a deficit of attention, I just can&rsquo;t focus it like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotypical">neurotypical</a> people do.</p>

<p>Biologically, people with ADHD have the <a href="https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-brain-prefrontal-cortex-attention-emotions/">prefrontal cortex of their brain all messed up</a>. That&rsquo;s the part regulating thoughts, feelings, impulses. The linked article gives a really good overview on that as well.</p>

<p>The other big biological factor is <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/adhd-dopamine">not having enough dopamine</a> in your brain, which is where most stimulant medication help. <a href="https://www.additudemag.com/stimulant-medications-for-adhd/">This ADDitude magazine article</a> has a good overview on them.</p>

<p>A large part of ADHD is what they call Executive Dysfunction (ED). <a href="https://www.additudemag.com/7-executive-function-deficits-linked-to-adhd/">This article has a good overview of it</a>; the parts that <em>I find affecting me</em> are issues with inhibition, working memory, emotional self-regulation, self-motivation and to a certain degree, planning. Let me extend on these.</p>

<h3 id="how-adhd-feels-like-and-looks-like-to-me">How ADHD feels like and looks like to me</h3>

<p>Issues with emotional self-regulation manifest in me with a sense of being constantly bombarded by and feeling helpless against overwhelming emotions, especially the negative ones. I am particularly extremely sensitive to rejection.</p>

<p>My long-term memory is pretty great, however my short-term (working) memory is absolutely terrible. With my attention frequently being as bad as a butterfly — insert &ldquo;look, squirrel!&rdquo; joke here — it&rsquo;s very easy to get lost in my thoughts and forget things.</p>

<p>There are things that help with this. Medication helps. Writing todo lists help. Breaking things down into subtasks help. Sticking to said todo-lists is eternally work-in-progress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t need to write this down, I will remember it&rdquo; is the biggest lie I keep telling myself, and I still fall for it. If I know I need something done and/or remembered, I&rsquo;ll 1. add it to my calendar 2. add it to my weekly todo list 3. make a reminder for it 4. if it&rsquo;s more important, make 2 or 3 reminders for it, because sometimes I just ignore the first reminder and forget about the whole thing.</p>

<hr />

<p>Problems around inhibition and impulsivity are abound. A lot of times, particularly with people, I either just close myself up completely or end up at the other extreme: blurt things out without thinking or start oversharing (people who know me and are reading this are heavily nodding at this point). For me, this applies to anger as well. I am the kind of person who suffers a lot silently in a relationship and then one day just blows up. I won&rsquo;t attribute this entirely to ADHD, and this is something I did and do work on in therapy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m impulsive in many things, but it&rsquo;s not all black and white. Being impulsive is not bad in itself; but what you&rsquo;re being impulsive with determines a lot. I used to be very impulsive with money for example; if I&rsquo;d have money left after my day-to-day expenses, I&rsquo;d spend it on some electronics. A few years after I started earning money I discovered <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/">YNAB</a> and budgeting — since then I&rsquo;m like 50% less bad with money.</p>

<p>Up until very recently, I had a hard time saving money, though that&rsquo;s also wrapped in anxieties you inherit when you grow up poor. Most of my working life, and especially in recent years I&rsquo;ve been fairly privileged in earning a good chunk of money, though.</p>

<hr />

<p>This brings me to my next topic, which explains many things, like the issue with saving money: I have a very myopic sense of time, not unlike one of a young child. It&rsquo;s hard for me to think long-term in general: for me, there is <em>now</em> and <em>not-now</em>. Now is what needs my immediate attention. Not-now is something I can worry about <em>later</em>. Sure I could save up, but that&rsquo;s not-now, and that simply doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p>Being a freelancer means having to manage my money and deal with sometimes irregular finances. Last year I got my first real long-term client, and that helped a lot. I could plan for things, and I have stumbled upon a stupid easy technique (besides budgeting) to stop myself from spending money that would be better saved for later: putting almost all my spare cash into deposits. It&rsquo;s still available, and it&rsquo;s only a few clicks away from being able to access it again, but those few clicks goes a long way to stop myself doing it. (They also earn an insultingly small amount of interest.)</p>

<p>Regarding motivation, one of the things that drive me most is a sense of novelty, which becomes my downfall as well. The dopamine hit it gives me is addictive. I find and start a new thing, I get immersed in it and I do it almost obsessively. Then the novelty wears off and I just stop doing it. I have a bazillion failed pet projects and abandoned hobbies.</p>

<p>This addiction to novelty generates what I call &ldquo;ADHD boredom&rdquo;, though I&rsquo;m sure there is a proper term for it. Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s the weekend, and I got nothing scheduled, which is really, really bad. Now, I lie to myself, great! A free weekend! I can do anything! I can just rest. This is a trap. <strong>Having free time is a trap</strong>.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t &ldquo;just rest&rdquo;. I am not capable of that and yet, even now I keep lying to myself that I can. I need to do things. And, while I could do about 10 different things — work on pet projects! draw! write! cook! etc. — oftentimes I can not bring myself to do anything. My brain, being the dopamine-junkie it is and frequently understimulated, wants something new (see also the section about spending money on shiny electronics above), and it just decided that. This is where we, once again, come back to the fact that I have a serious issue consciously focusing my attention on something.</p>

<p>And this is why I&rsquo;ll frequently end up on the couch, mindlessly watching TV series or movies, and not even enjoying them, it&rsquo;s really just to pass the time. It&rsquo;s anything but <em>living</em>. I want to do <em>so many things</em> and it really sucks that I just can&rsquo;t oftentimes.</p>

<hr />

<p>I used to be really disorganized, although that has improved a lot over the years, with the todo lists and other techniques I&rsquo;ve mentioned above. Don&rsquo;t get me started about all the shame I picked up in school from teachers criticizing me for having a messy desk or my parent&rsquo;s constant frustration of the mess in my room. Decluttering often makes things worse; nowadays I strive towards organized chaos.</p>

<p>Structure and habits is an issue; it is a constant fight between being very rigid with my schedule/life/habits or just winging everything. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m really good at improvising things, but it gets exhausting. On the other hand, starting a habit and sticking to habit is capital-h Hard, and so far I&rsquo;ve found that for it to work long-term, it needs to be somewhat flexible, or I&rsquo;ll just stop it after a few months if I get that far. That applies to writing as well; I don&rsquo;t know how long I can keep up the 300 words a day thing. For now, it works, but I know there will come a point where it&rsquo;ll feel like a prison (hey Owen can we have that vacation days feature sooner rather than later?).</p>

<p>Deciding things can be really hard, excruciatingly hard. So far the only solution I&rsquo;ve found is to, wait for it, just pick something. I know this is not helpful at all, but that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m at.</p>

<p>All of this makes getting things done difficult, especially the mundane and monotonous. The techniques I&rsquo;ve mentioned in the previous paragraphs help. Deadlines help. I still procrastinate a lot, and to a certain degree I&rsquo;ve accepted it, and I am working extremely hard not to beat myself up because of it. And oftentimes it&rsquo;s productive procrastination; I do something useful and needed while avoiding something else. Like, writing this article.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you want to know more about what ADHD feels like, <a href="https://gekk.info/articles/adhd.html">read this</a> because I feel like I&rsquo;m just repeating things from this article. I am legit scared to open it now before I publish this because that&rsquo;d make this post about twice as long.</p>

<h3 id="being-on-meds-and-also-adhd-is-not-alone">Being on meds and also, ADHD is not alone</h3>

<p>Taking stimulant medication the first time in my adult life was life-changing. It&rsquo;s not a magic bullet, but as I&rsquo;ve mentioned above, it helps a lot in many things. It brings me to a baseline, just a tiny bit closer to neurotypical people, in terms of being able to get things done, especially the mundane, tedious things of life. It removes a certain amount of &ldquo;fog&rdquo; I feel in my brain without them.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that ADHD does not exist in a vacuum. It can be and more often not is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity">comorbid</a> with a lot of other mental health issues. Anxiety, Depression, OCD and so on — <a href="https://www.additudemag.com/when-its-not-just-adhd/">you can find a good article and list here</a>. Everything I&rsquo;ve just described can mostly be explained through the lens of ADHD, but definitely not exclusively.</p>

<h3 id="the-rest-of-my-story">The rest of my story</h3>

<p>Last time we saw our protagonist — about two dozen paragraphs ago — he got rediagnosed and started taking stimulant medication again. What could have possibly gone wrong?</p>

<p>Plenty, as it turns out. A couple of months after starting my meds again, my lifelong untreated anxiety issues reached a breaking point, and I started having panic attacks. It forced me to seek help finally and so I did: I started a medication that helped me a lot, but I also had to take another break from Ritalin, one that would last a bit more, than a year. During that time, my anxiety issues improved, I moved to Sweden in January 2013, and I also started going to therapy.</p>

<p>Through a stroke of luck, I got to a government-funded psychiatrist pretty quickly in Sweden. What seems unreal looking back is that I literally walked into his office, told him my history over the next 90 minutes, discussed what medications I need and he simply prescribed them. I would later learn that this is almost an exception and a lot of places in the world want some sort of proof in writing, and they won&rsquo;t just take your word for it.</p>

<p>And so I was back on Ritalin once again, and it certainly helped things.</p>

<hr />

<p>It&rsquo;s 2019 now, and a lot has changed. I&rsquo;ve done therapy for almost six years. Right now I&rsquo;m taking a break, one that&rsquo;s necessary given that I finished up two relationships with two therapists within two months at the end of 2018 (long story).</p>

<p>I cannot stress enough how much therapy — once you found the right therapist! — helps, not just with ADHD, but with just about&hellip; everything? Nothing can replace doing the hard work of sifting through all your past issues and traumas that shaped you, especially in your childhood. It&rsquo;s been life-changing for me, and I highly recommend it to literally everyone, if you can afford it and/or your insurance covers it. Once my break is over I will very likely continue the work.</p>

<p><em>There are also ADHD coaches, which I don&rsquo;t have much experience with, but they are a thing, and many people find them helpful, though costly. Leave a comment if you&rsquo;ve ever had one! I&rsquo;d love to know more about those experiences.</em></p>

<p>The ADHD medications I take has changed a bunch of times during those years, and right now I&rsquo;m on a lowish dosage of Elvanse (Vyvanse) combined with some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanfacine">Guanfacine</a>. I really wish instant-release Adderall would be available in Europe because based on my experience with all other past meds, I have a hunch that it&rsquo;s the thing that would work for me the best, but until then I&rsquo;ll work with what&rsquo;s available.</p>

<p>Elvanse has a very different effect on me compared to Ritalin (I tried both IR, then XR, then a combination of both). The latter was effective, but it did raise my already high anxiety levels, and we could never quite compensate for that. There&rsquo;s also the fact that high anxiety gives constant issues with my stomach acid. Ritalin had what my psychiatrist calls the &ldquo;throat to the knife&rdquo; effect; it helped me to get things done partly by giving me a specific kind of anxiety, not unlike to a strict parent standing over my shoulder threateningly. It does kinda work, but it is also not quite right. Oh yeah, and it also made me increasingly depressed and miserable.</p>

<p>Switching to Elvanse was a revelation. I no longer have a knife to my throat, and my anxiety and depressiveness improved a lot. I&rsquo;m also a lot less miserable and much happier in general; one of the things I noticed is that I&rsquo;m laughing a lot more again. The downside of it is that many of my ADHD symptoms are a lot worse, especially my working memory and forgetfulness. I feel downright stupid sometimes. But for now, for me, it&rsquo;s definitely worth the tradeoff.</p>

<p>Let me finish this section with the important disclosure that while I share these experiences with the hope it helps others, it is a very well known fact among psychiatrists that people react to stimulant medication in wildly different ways. <strong>What works for me may not work for you.</strong> A good psychiatrist can help you find the right medication and the correct dosage.</p>

<hr />

<p>I did not list all the meds I take here, and stimulant medications are not the only medications for ADHD. Again, find a good psychiatrist.</p>

<p><em>I would love to geek out more about ADHD medication with others and trade stories in private; find me on social media, I&rsquo;m KTamas just about everywhere (except on <a href="http://instagram.com/user/ktamasenty">Instagram</a>).</em></p>

<h3 id="adhd-a-success-story">ADHD: a success story?</h3>

<p>I am <strong>really good at solving problems</strong> and I have no issues whatsoever boasting about that. The other thing I am also really good at is learning new things, and learning them fast. If something interests me, I can jump on them, study them obsessively and get productive, fast. That&rsquo;s literally at least half of why people hire me, even though &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know X but trust me I will learn it in a week, several people can attest to that&rdquo; is a hard sell sometimes. But I make it work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a freelancer, and half of my work comes by word-of-mouth: I work with people and then they recommend me to other people. I&rsquo;m pretty damn good at selling myself because I have no shame or impostor syndrome when talking with prospective clients (I reserve those feelings to the rest of my time on earth). I&rsquo;m also somewhat extraverted and good at networking. Going to conferences and networking the shit out of them is the other way I get jobs. That&rsquo;s my &ldquo;secret&rdquo; for having a successful freelancing business for three years and counting.</p>

<p>That, and the fact that — by far and large — I do good work, or so my clients tell me.</p>

<hr />

<p>Many of the traits and skills I described are frequently attributed to ADHD, which would bring me to my next point: <strong>ADHD doesn&rsquo;t get to define me</strong>. It is a diagnosis and a label. Used wisely, it&rsquo;s an explanation but never an excuse.</p>

<p>I struggle with some other mental health issues with as well, and none of them are isolated; as I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, comorbidity plays a significant role. Indeed, before saying goodbye to my last therapist, he told me that in the grand scheme of things, the issues I attribute to ADHD are the minority of my actual problems in my life right now. And I&rsquo;m pretty sure he is right.</p>

<h3 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h3>

<p>There are a lot of things I have not touched upon these articles, but I hope it will at least get you thinking. It&rsquo;s still something that in some ways is still underdiagnosed.</p>

<p>ADHD is not a life sentence; having a diagnosis, a good psychiatrist, a good therapist, a good coach (ideally, all of them) can improve things tremendously.</p>

<p>The origins of ADHD is something that&rsquo;s still unclear, with many theories going around and consensus on it. It <em>seems</em> that in <em>some way</em> it&rsquo;s hereditary, but the jury is still very much out on how much of it is nature and how much of it may be nurture. It does run in my family; several family members and some of my siblings have it. I&rsquo;d be lying if I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;m not worried that some of my kids may grow up with it, too. One of the books I&rsquo;m recommending below has an interesting theory that very much fits my life story; however that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s the definitive answer.</p>

<p>A very important caveat to everything I wrote about, and especially the part on how ADHD feels like to me is heavily colored by the fact that I&rsquo;m a guy. ADHD for women can and does look very different oftentimes; <a href="https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-symptoms-in-women/">ADDitude magazine has an article to get you started reading up on it</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;d be remiss if I wouldn&rsquo;t acknowledge the fact that, depending on where you live and what your financial situation is, all of the above can be very expensive and a lot of people simply can&rsquo;t afford that. I know I am in a very privileged position to do so, and it sucks that I don&rsquo;t have a solution for those who don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I hope you found these posts informative; I&rsquo;m happy to answer questions in the comments, social media or in private.</p>

<h3 id="epilogue-a-reading-list">Epilogue: a reading list</h3>

<p>A while ago, I compiled a list of books that helped me learn about ADHD. Maybe it&rsquo;ll help you, too.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/You-Mean-Lazy-Stupid-Crazy/dp/0743264487/">You Mean I&rsquo;m Not Lazy, Stupid or Crazy?!: The Classic Self-Help Book for Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder</a><br />
It is the classic self-help book and an excellent first read to get you into the topic.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Delivered-Distraction-Getting-Attention-Disorder/dp/0345442318/">Delivered from Distraction: Getting the Most out of Life with Attention Deficit Disorder</a><br />
This is an excellent book to follow up the first with if you are not overwhelmed already. It is technically the second book in a series (the first one being Driven to Distraction) but stands on its own.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006QL0VJC/">Your Life Can Be Better: using strategies for Adult ADD/ADHD</a>
This is excellent and practical, structured into concise chapters. After you get your dose of theory (and strategies) from the first two books, this gives you a whole lot more that are helpful.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UZDTFG/">Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates and What You Can Do About It</a><br />
I believe this is <em>one of the most important books</em> I&rsquo;ve read about ADHD. It has changed my view on it profoundly, and I consider it a must-read. It has sections on both childhood, and adult ADHD and his two chapters about nurturing your inner child are something I re-read every couple of months.</p>

<p>The book poses the theory that ADHD is a combination of being born with an above-average sensitivity to outside impulses and early childhood trauma, primarily the lack of proper attachment/attunement to the caregiver parent (typically the mother). Again, this fits me; but it may not fit you, and it&rsquo;s not that mainstream. Then again, mainstream is still pretty scattered — pun not intended — on the origins of ADHD.</p>

<h3 id="from-wordpress-to-jekyll-to-hugo">From Wordpress to Jekyll to Hugo</h3>

<p>About a week ago I decided it was time to migrate it to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I was bored, and it gave me a good excuse to play with a static site generator. Plus, doing this kind of conversion became a rite of passage for people working in tech these days.</p>

<p><em>This is not a complete guide; you can find hundreds of them with a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+wordpress+to+jekyll">quick google</a>. I will, however, provide a general overview of the process with some helpful pointers and links.</em></p>

<p>I started by migrating all the comments to Disqus with their <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/disqus-comment-system/">official Wordpress plugin</a>. After that, I used a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jekyll-exporter/">Jekyll exporter plugin</a> that converted all my posts into markdown&hellip; except it stripped all the embeds.</p>

<p>I used to blog a lot about music, so I had a lot of embeds, mostly from Youtube. In retrospect, I could have saved myself some time by patching the exporter or finding another one. In the end, however, I ended up fixing every single post by hand. I replaced old, pre-iframe flash embed codes with updated ones and changed the newer, but still http ones to https. In most places, if the video was not necessary or wasn&rsquo;t available anymore, I added the song to the post via Spotify. The chances of a given song being up on Spotify in a few years feels <em>marginally</em> higher than on Youtube right now. I had a few other embeds that I could fix with newer code (Soundcloud) and others that I couldn&rsquo;t (Deezer), but most of the time I could find the given song or playlist within Spotify. All of this had the benefit of walking down on memory lane, reading 10-year old blog posts and cringing a lot. <em>I was so young.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;ve found a <a href="https://github.com/vinitkumar/white-paper">reasonably decent theme</a> for Jekyll, which felt like a good starting point, though it didn&rsquo;t have built-in support for tags or archives. I started googling how to implement that, and around the same time I was venting about my embed issues on the XOXO slack. That was when <a href="https://twitter.com/theory">David</a> chimed in about his experiences on doing this exact same process, except he ended up using <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, another popular static site generator that&rsquo;s kind of like Jekyll except faster. <a href="https://github.com/theory/justatheory/tree/master/themes/justatheory">The theme</a> of <a href="https://justatheory.com">his blog</a> had everything I wanted: a fancy archives page and proper support for tags. So I figured I might as well continue my journey: switch to Hugo and use his theme as a basis.</p>

<p>Jekyll is written in Ruby and uses a simple templating language. Hugo&rsquo;s code is in Go, and it uses Go&rsquo;s own templates; they definitely have a learning curve, even if you have coded in Go before. With some help, googling and a lot of trial and error, I got the hang of it and managed to change things to my liking as well as the look and the color scheme of the site. I converted most of my posts&rsquo; <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">front matter</a> <a href="https://github.com/coderzh/ConvertToHugo">with a script</a> and fixed the rest with a few search-and-replaces. With 8-10 hours of work behind me — half of that was fixing those embeds — I had my new blog ready to be <a href="https://pages.github.com/">hosted on Github Pages for free</a>. I use a modified version of the <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#put-it-into-a-script-1">sample deploy script</a> they have in Hugo&rsquo;s documentation.</p>

<h3 id="getting-rid-of-my-vps">Getting Rid of My VPS</h3>

<p>I had a small VPS at Linode for years now, hosting my pet projects, my blog and a bunch of static sites (like my <a href="https://ktamas.com">home page</a>) over the years. It also had OpenVPN installed so I could watch iPlayer for free until BBC started cracking down on that. By now it only had my blog and those static sites; I figured if I could find something for the latter, I could ditch the VPS entirely.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember how, but I came across <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a>. They give you free static hosting with extremely generous soft limits (100 gigs of storage, 100 GB/month transfer). You just point them to a Github repository, and about 30 seconds later you have your site ready, with support for multiple custom domains and SSL.</p>

<p>I spent an hour or two moving everything to Netlify, changing the necessary DNS entries and in the end, I was ready to say goodbye to my VPS and save a grand total of $7 a month in the future. I made backups of everything and then, somewhat emotionally pressed the &ldquo;Delete&rdquo; button on Linode&rsquo;s control panel. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if I would get another one eventually for a side project or something, but for now, I&rsquo;m happy with my all my stuff hosted around the internet for free and stored in git repos.</p>

<p>There is a lot more content to come as I started writing regularly. Feel free to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/KTamasBlog">subscribe to this blog</a> in your favorite RSS reader.</p>

<p>Hugo gives me a lot of ways to tinker; I am already thinking about replacing the commenting system, adding reading time, word count and so on. I might write something on this in again in the future.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m sitting in a wine bar and waiting for my friends to arrive to hang out. I spent my free time today working my converting my blog from Wordpress to Hugo — with a detour of Jekyll — and moving my static sites to Netlify so that I can shut down my barely-used VPS. A full write-up about this is coming soon.</p>

<p>I have about 20 minutes before said friends arrive so this will be one of those stream of consciousness posts where I just start writing and see what comes out of it.</p>

<hr />

<p>For the longest time, I did not like neither beer nor wine. Sure, both are acquired tastes, but I tried plenty (especially beer) and it just never clicked. To this day the only beer I drink is alcohol-free lager since it&rsquo;s the one that tastes the least like actual beer and it has the advantage of, well, not having alcohol in it. If I wanted to get tipsy or drunk I would go with shots or cocktails. That changed in recent years, though; I finally got a taste of wine, dry red wine, to be exact.</p>

<hr />

<p>I mentioned a bunch of times already that in 2012 my untreated anxiety disorder got to the point where I started having panic attacks and forced me to seek treatment. One of the side-effects of all this is that my stomach was shot. I had severe discomfort/pain for months; at one point, someone accidentally figured out that the primary cause was high stomach acid and antacid pills help. Slowly, I started recovering. To aid the process and my digestion (in retrospect, maybe my anxiety as well), my old GP, who was somewhat old-school prescribed me a deciliter of red wine, every day, after lunch. It&rsquo;s not like I had anything to lose, and it&rsquo;s not enough alcohol to get me tipsy anyway.</p>

<p>So I did that for like two months, and after a few weeks, I started not hating red wine. A few weeks after that, I was a convert. Since then it became my go-to drink of choice.</p>

<hr />

<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about wine. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good&rdquo; or &ldquo;It sucks&rdquo; is as far as I can go. I did develop preferences over the years; by far and large, I like a good Merlot or Pinot Noir. Above all, Shiraz (Syrah) wines, mostly from Australia and New Zealand are among my favorites.</p>

<p>When I lived in Sweden, I had the luxury of having a selection of 100s of different wines from at least 20 different countries. See, in Sweden, there is a government monopoly on selling alcohol above 3.5%; you can only buy the serious stuff in state-run alcohol shops. The pros and cons of this system are beyond the scope of this post, but one huge pro was the selection I&rsquo;ve mentioned above.</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;m back in Hungary now, and though there are stores where you can get import wine, most of the wine here is local. Which is not a bad thing, of course; Hungarian is a wine country, and our wine is renowned for its quality. I do miss being able to pick from all the different countries, though.</p>

<hr />

<p>My friends started arriving. Time for me to order a glass of Syrah&hellip;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Last night I went to bed feeling I might be getting sick, and I woke up most definitely sick. It feels like something in-between a cold and full-blown flu, and I mean, whatever, it&rsquo;ll pass. What bothers me is the timing: I started working with a personal trainer last week and been to 4 classes so far. Now I&rsquo;ll have to skip a bunch, and that&rsquo;s bad when you are building a habit.</p>

<p>I have at least one more post ready in my SF &amp; XOXO 2018 series (to come), but right now I&rsquo;m struggling to write end edit the ones that come after them. So I&rsquo;m taking a break today to reflect on writing, and in particular, writing here.</p>

<hr />

<p>This is my 31st post here, and I have not skipped a single day. I joined the day Owen opened signups. It&rsquo;s the second longest personal writing streak I have — the first one would be the one I did when I moved to Sweden and blogged about my life daily for the first few months. I&rsquo;m sure I skipped days here and there, but I wrote a lot during those days.</p>

<p>I used the term personal writing intentionally. Back in 2003, shortly after I started high school, I started working for a tech news site covering mobile devices, phones and PDAs.</p>

<p><em>(remember PDAs? I was</em> really <em>into them and had several over the years, even smartphones, and this was years before the iPhone. That&rsquo;s where most of the money I earned went.)</em></p>

<p>I kept track of what&rsquo;s up with the tech world and wrote a news article about whatever I&rsquo;ve found interesting and fit my scope. For the first two years or so I did it for free; after that, I earned roughly 75 cents per news article. I wrote a few features, reviews and interviews as well (can&rsquo;t remember how much I made from that, but not a lot).</p>

<p>In many ways, it was the dream writing job. I could write about anything I wanted, and the money I earned with it was significant for a 17-year old still living with their parents. I do feel somewhat ripped off financially in retrospect, though.</p>

<p>I stopped working for the site not long before I finished high school — I sort of lost interest. I think it had run its course.</p>

<p>Some habits do stay with me to this day from that era. Keeping up with the news is one of the reasons I got addicted to RSS and Google Reader. I read The Verge&rsquo;s and Ars Technica&rsquo;s feed religiously to this day, even though it is no longer necessary and I skip reading like 95% of it.</p>

<hr />

<p>All of the writing I mentioned above has been in Hungarian, though. This is the first time I am writing a significant amount in English, a language that&rsquo;s not my mother tongue. Now, I pride myself having a good grasp on the English language, and have been fluent in it since I was 15 or so. I don&rsquo;t even have the stereotypical Hungarian accent; it sounds like generic American English to most ears. When I lived in Sweden, I spoke English 90% of the time. I can and still do think in English a lot. When I&rsquo;m alone and am talking to myself, that&rsquo;s often in English as well.</p>

<p>And yet, writing is a different beast entirely. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m bad at it, but I&rsquo;m conscious of the fact that I&rsquo;m not great either, and have a lot to learn. I run everything I write through Grammarly and Hemingway, and they help, but they&rsquo;re not silver bullets. I started reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0090RVGW0/">On Writing Well</a> (<a href="https://writetogether.space/posts/owen/the-tyranny-of-writing">thanks, Owen</a>), since nonfiction writing is my thing. And posting here at least 300 words every day itself helps a lot.</p>

<hr />

<p>So here I am, 31 days later; a month done, who knows how many to go. And I enjoy it a lot, even though I have no metrics on how many people are reading these posts of mine (I like having an audience and will not apologize for that). For now, I&rsquo;ll go back to editing and rewriting my series. I have work to do.</p>
