The first few months were much harder, than I thought it would be, with the newfound freedom bringing much more free time, but a lot of stress, financial and otherwise. However, now I am six months in, and I have already worked with several clients, sorted out accounting (ugh), realized it\u0026#8217;s a really bad idea to have my work e-mail mixed with my personal ones, and I\u0026#8217;m heading to Southern Europe for 2 months in a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI got a two-month consulting gig at a translation agency doing some integration work (read: software development) with their workflow system, customer portal and a popular CAT tool. Perks include being in warm and sunny Barcelona for a week and in even warmer and sunnier Bologna afterwards. I even get to have a mini-vacation in Marseille just before, courtesy of a very good friend of mine who has a flat there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 id=\"photography\"\u003ePhotography\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI have written a neat little gear post about three times now, but I am never satisfied with it, so here\u0026#8217;s the short version with some links, and a longer one coming soon (or not).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn January I got an \u003ca href=\"http://www.eyefi.com/products/mobi\"\u003eEye-Fi Mobi\u003c/a\u003e card, turning my 6D into a ginourmous point-and-shoot that sends all the pictures I take to my iPhone in 20 seconds. It is perfect for JPEG shooting (way too slow for RAW work), and gave several month\u0026#8217;s of motivation to lug my DSLR around everywhere with me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn my iPhone 6 Plus (yes, it\u0026#8217;s big; but the camera, the battery and the screen real estate makes up for it, most of the time) I use the built-in Photos app for cropping picture and VSCO for editing; it handles the 22mpx files surprisingly well. Even with its limits and the occasional crashes, I have found \u003ca href=\"https://vsco.co/vscocam\"\u003eVSCO\u003c/a\u003e to be by far the best photo editor on mobile, and I have tried plenty other (Afterlight, Darkroom, Enlight etc.). Hell, I bought most of the filter packs, even though usually I loathe spending money on In-app purchases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother permanent addition to my camera bag is the \u003ca href=\"http://www.fujifilm.com/products/instant_photo/printers/instax_share_sp_1/\"\u003eFuji Instax Share\u003c/a\u003e printer, that prints 2\u0026#215;3\u0026#8243; pictures from my smartphone onto Fuji Instax Mini film. It\u0026#8217;s expensive, the film is expensive and the quality is okay at best and I do not care about any of these, because it is fucking magic. I can take a picture on my 6D, have it on my phone, print it out, and give it to the person I took the picture of, in about 2 minutes. That is something you can not measure in money. It is also an excellent ice-breaker in a many social situations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLast but not least, with the help of my friend Krisztián I fell in love with Fuji\u0026#8217;s X series ILC cameras, having used an \u003ca href=\"http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x_e1/\"\u003eX-E1\u003c/a\u003e and the \u003ca href=\"http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf35mmf14_r/\"\u003e35mm f/1.4\u003c/a\u003e for a few days when I was in Budapest in May. Afterwards I got myself the newer X-E2, but I quickly realized that I hate the new sensor\u0026#8217;s colors and tones, not to mention the dreadful \u0026#8220;plastic skin\u0026#8221; issue on the JPEGs (\u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=fuji+plastic+skin\"\u003egoogle fuji plastic skin\u003c/a\u003e, if you are interested\u0026#8230;), in which noise reduction goes crazy and makes you look like a wax figure. So I returned the X-E2, got myself a new-old-stock X-E1 with the kit \u003ca href=\"http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf18_55mmf28_4_r_lm_ois/\"\u003e18-55mm f/2.8-4\u003c/a\u003e lens, which is an excellent, excellent lens. I have my eyes set on the \u003ca href=\"http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf56mmf12_r/\"\u003e56mm f/1.2\u003c/a\u003e and the one of the ultrawide lenses, but that\u0026#8217;s for another time. Fuji helps you to be careful with your lens purchases by making them really expensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe X-E1 may have a slower EVF and autofocus than the X-E2, but it makes gorgeous black and white JPEGs that are the best I have ever seen. My 6D\u0026#8217;s JPEGs look rubbish in comparison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost of my pictures nowadays end up on my \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KTamas\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/ktamasenty/\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e accounts, so add me there, if you are interested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 id=\"languages\"\u003eLanguages\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy now I got to a \u0026#8220;shitty conversational\u0026#8221; level with Swedish, with \u003ca href=\"http://duolingo.com\"\u003eDuolingo\u003c/a\u003e\u0026#8216;s course being a big help sorting out some of my grammar issues and expanding my vocabulary a bit. I still lack practice and construct sentences in English in my head, but it is progress. With practice, it will improve, and I am not in a hurry. Also, by now I am pretty good at understanding Swedish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI also started learning Ukrainian (on Duolingo, of course). I have many Russian-speaking friends (most of them are from Ukraine or Latvia) and I want to be able to talk with them without a lot of Google/Yandex Translate. I also like languages, so why not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut why Ukrainian, and not Russian, asks everyone? Because I was interested and they don\u0026#8217;t have a Russian course on Duolingo yet, that\u0026#8217;s why and Duolingo is pretty much the only language-learning software that keeps me motivated enough. Ukrainian is also a beautiful language (Russian is somewhat less so, in my not-so-humble opinion), and a bit easier; also, most of my Russian-speaking friends can understand and/or speak Ukrainian. Meanwhile I pick up a fair amount of Russian just by listening to them speaking. It can be hard to keep the two languages separate in my head, but at this point, it helps that I can mix them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not an easy language: the grammar has similarities to Hungarian with three genders (okay, we don\u0026#8217;t have genders in Hungarian), an excessive number of cases and conjugations, virtually no fixed word order, and euphony (but we do have all of these). Nevertheless, I really enjoy learning it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 id=\"to-be-continued\"\u003eTo be continued\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEventually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfooter\u003e\n    \u003ca title=\"Permanent link to “Mid-year status update”\" href=\"https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2015/06/24/mid-year-status-update/\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/a\u003e\n    By KTamas for \u003ca href=\"https://blog.ktamas.com/\"\u003eKTamas\u0026#39; Blog\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003cdiv class=\"tags\"\u003e\n            \u003ch5\u003eMore about…\u003c/h5\u003e\n            \u003cul\u003e\n                \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/2015/\"\u003e2015\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n                \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/%C3%A9nblog/\"\u003eénblog\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n                \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/fot%C3%B3z%C3%A1s/\"\u003efotózás\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n                \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://blog.ktamas.com/tags/sv%C3%A9dorsz%C3%A1g/\"\u003esvédország\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n            \u003c/ul\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/footer\u003e",
