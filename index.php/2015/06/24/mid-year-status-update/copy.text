Mid-year status update
======================


# Work

I quit my day job at the end of last year to become a freelance consultant, and so far it has been going well. The first few months were much harder, than I thought it would be, with the newfound freedom bringing much more free time, but a lot of stress, financial and otherwise. However, now I am six months in, and I have already worked with several clients, sorted out accounting (ugh), realized it&#8217;s a really bad idea to have my work e-mail mixed with my personal ones, and I&#8217;m heading to Southern Europe for 2 months in a week.

I got a two-month consulting gig at a translation agency doing some integration work (read: software development) with their workflow system, customer portal and a popular CAT tool. Perks include being in warm and sunny Barcelona for a week and in even warmer and sunnier Bologna afterwards. I even get to have a mini-vacation in Marseille just before, courtesy of a very good friend of mine who has a flat there.

# Photography

I have written a neat little gear post about three times now, but I am never satisfied with it, so here&#8217;s the short version with some links, and a longer one coming soon (or not).

In January I got an [Eye-Fi Mobi](http://www.eyefi.com/products/mobi) card, turning my 6D into a ginourmous point-and-shoot that sends all the pictures I take to my iPhone in 20 seconds. It is perfect for JPEG shooting (way too slow for RAW work), and gave several month&#8217;s of motivation to lug my DSLR around everywhere with me again.

On my iPhone 6 Plus (yes, it&#8217;s big; but the camera, the battery and the screen real estate makes up for it, most of the time) I use the built-in Photos app for cropping picture and VSCO for editing; it handles the 22mpx files surprisingly well. Even with its limits and the occasional crashes, I have found [VSCO](https://vsco.co/vscocam) to be by far the best photo editor on mobile, and I have tried plenty other (Afterlight, Darkroom, Enlight etc.). Hell, I bought most of the filter packs, even though usually I loathe spending money on In-app purchases.

Another permanent addition to my camera bag is the [Fuji Instax Share](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/instant_photo/printers/instax_share_sp_1/) printer, that prints 2&#215;3&#8243; pictures from my smartphone onto Fuji Instax Mini film. It&#8217;s expensive, the film is expensive and the quality is okay at best and I do not care about any of these, because it is fucking magic. I can take a picture on my 6D, have it on my phone, print it out, and give it to the person I took the picture of, in about 2 minutes. That is something you can not measure in money. It is also an excellent ice-breaker in a many social situations.

Last but not least, with the help of my friend Krisztián I fell in love with Fuji&#8217;s X series ILC cameras, having used an [X-E1](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x_e1/) and the [35mm f/1.4](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf35mmf14_r/) for a few days when I was in Budapest in May. Afterwards I got myself the newer X-E2, but I quickly realized that I hate the new sensor&#8217;s colors and tones, not to mention the dreadful &#8220;plastic skin&#8221; issue on the JPEGs ([google fuji plastic skin](https://www.google.com/search?q=fuji+plastic+skin), if you are interested&#8230;), in which noise reduction goes crazy and makes you look like a wax figure. So I returned the X-E2, got myself a new-old-stock X-E1 with the kit [18-55mm f/2.8-4](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf18_55mmf28_4_r_lm_ois/) lens, which is an excellent, excellent lens. I have my eyes set on the [56mm f/1.2](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf56mmf12_r/) and the one of the ultrawide lenses, but that&#8217;s for another time. Fuji helps you to be careful with your lens purchases by making them really expensive.

The X-E1 may have a slower EVF and autofocus than the X-E2, but it makes gorgeous black and white JPEGs that are the best I have ever seen. My 6D&#8217;s JPEGs look rubbish in comparison.

Most of my pictures nowadays end up on my [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/KTamas) or [Instagram](http://instagram.com/ktamasenty/) accounts, so add me there, if you are interested.

# Languages

By now I got to a &#8220;shitty conversational&#8221; level with Swedish, with [Duolingo](http://duolingo.com)&#8216;s course being a big help sorting out some of my grammar issues and expanding my vocabulary a bit. I still lack practice and construct sentences in English in my head, but it is progress. With practice, it will improve, and I am not in a hurry. Also, by now I am pretty good at understanding Swedish.

I also started learning Ukrainian (on Duolingo, of course). I have many Russian-speaking friends (most of them are from Ukraine or Latvia) and I want to be able to talk with them without a lot of Google/Yandex Translate. I also like languages, so why not.

But why Ukrainian, and not Russian, asks everyone? Because I was interested and they don&#8217;t have a Russian course on Duolingo yet, that&#8217;s why and Duolingo is pretty much the only language-learning software that keeps me motivated enough. Ukrainian is also a beautiful language (Russian is somewhat less so, in my not-so-humble opinion), and a bit easier; also, most of my Russian-speaking friends can understand and/or speak Ukrainian. Meanwhile I pick up a fair amount of Russian just by listening to them speaking. It can be hard to keep the two languages separate in my head, but at this point, it helps that I can mix them.

It is not an easy language: the grammar has similarities to Hungarian with three genders (okay, we don&#8217;t have genders in Hungarian), an excessive number of cases and conjugations, virtually no fixed word order, and euphony (but we do have all of these). Nevertheless, I really enjoy learning it.

# To be continued

Eventually.
