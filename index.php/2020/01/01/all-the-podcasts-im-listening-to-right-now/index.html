<p>I&rsquo;ve had friends over two days ago and we got to talk about podcasts, so I figured I&rsquo;d take stock and see what I&rsquo;m listening to these days. I&rsquo;m subscribed to 98 podcasts in PocketCasts, but the ones that are in active rotation are a fraction of that. I usually listen to podcasts when I went to bed because I need some sort of noise to fall asleep more often than not.</p>
<p>Some of these are also radio shows (like the ones by NPR, among others) but I&rsquo;ll just refer to most of them as podcasts for simplicity&rsquo;s sake. Quotes mean I took the description from directly the source.</p>
