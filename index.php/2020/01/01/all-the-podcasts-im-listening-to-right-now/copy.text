All the Podcasts I'm Listening to Right Now
===========================================

I've had friends over two days ago and we got to talk about podcasts, so I figured I'd take stock and see what I'm listening to these days. I'm subscribed to 98 podcasts in PocketCasts, but the ones that are in active rotation are a fraction of that. I usually listen to podcasts when I went to bed because I need some sort of noise to fall asleep more often than not.

Some of these are also radio shows (like the ones by NPR, among others) but I'll just refer to most of them as podcasts for simplicity's sake. Quotes mean I took the description from directly the source.

### Ongoing

* **[30 for 30](https://pod.link/1244784611)**: *"Original audio documentaries from the makers of the acclaimed 30 for 30 film series, featuring stories from the world of sports and beyond."* Look I don't care much about sports but so many of these stories are incredible.

Revealing conversation, surprise stories and lots of laughs."* I'm not much for the celebrity interview genre but this one is an exception because almost all of these interviews are exceptionally good.  
Episode to start with: [Olivia Colman](https://pod.link/1450005207/ep/1000428601798).
* **[Extremities](https://pod.link/1467292185)**: *"Why and how people live in earth's most isolated and extreme settlements."* Each season is about a different place: Pitcairn Island, Svalbard and Saint Helena in its latest season.

* **[Friendshipping](https://pod.link/971362201)**: *"Every week Jenn & Trin answer your questions about friendship."* It's a great podcast but it's the one I put on when I really want to fall asleep; for some reason, it really does it for me.  
Episode to start with: any, really.
* **[Heavyweight](https://pod.link/1150800298)**: Stories of people who lived with regrets for years or even decades and want to find out what happened, or how to fix it. Its 4th season is the best so far, where almost every story is amazing.

With candour and humour, Michelle delves into the deepest, darkest aspects of her divorce and her new life as a part-time parent, part-time partier."* This is a complete series with three seasons.

* **[Launch](https://pod.link/1319436103)**: *"Three out of five people dream of writing a book. Maybe you're one of them. But what does it take to go from dream to launch? Screenwriter John August (Go, Big Fish, Charlie and The Chocolate Factory) sought to find out as he tackled something he’d only ever dreamed of: writing a novel. From Wondery, A Network Of Storytellers, this is a show about putting something out into the world. How will it turn out?
