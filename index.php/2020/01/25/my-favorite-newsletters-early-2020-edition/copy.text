My Favorite Newsletters (Early 2020 Edition)
============================================

I love newsletters and I read quite a few of them. I [made a list a bit more than a year ago](https://writetogether.space/posts/ktamas/my-favorite-newsletters) and a few things have changed since then. I compiled this list for the XOXO slack yesterday and I figured it'd be good to share it here as well. These are the things I read these days.

- [Nicole Knows](https://nicole.substack.com/) is [The Toast](http://the-toast.net/) alum [Nicole Cliffe](http://twitter.com/nicole_cliffe)'s newsletter, do yourself a favor and follow her on twitter immediately as well. It's a mix of fun and weird Reddit threads and skincare. [[archives](https://nicole.substack.com/)]
- [The week that was](https://buttondown.email/Iankennedy) by [Ian Kennedy](https://twitter.com/iankennedy) is a weekly newsletter with usually ten links to interesting, unusual stories from all over the world. [[archives](https://everwas.com/tag/weekthatwas/)]
- [Things That Have Caught My Attention](https://danhon.substack.com/) by [Dan Hon](http://twitter.com/hondanhon). Fascinating reads about the intersection of technology and, well, life, I guess. [[archives](https://tinyletter.com/danhon/archive)]
- [Recs](http://fimoculous.com/recs/) by [Rex Sorgatz](https://twitter.com/fimoculous), which relaunched recently, gives you a fresh dose of interesting things to read from the web. [[archives](http://fimoculous.com/recs/)]
- [The Morning Missive](https://tinyletter.com/amynw) by [Amy Widdowsson](https://twitter.com/amynw) is a semi-daily newsletter of, again, interesting links. [[archives](https://tinyletter.com/amynw/archive)]
- [Emchap's Shit](https://tinyletter.com/emchap) by [Emily Chapman](https://twitter.com/eachapm) is a weekly newsletter of, you guessed it, interesting links and a story and a recipe. [[archives](https://tinyletter.com/emchap/archive)]
- [Desk Lunch](https://www.desklunchnewsletter.com/) is a weekly newsletter, "A community for all creative people of marginalized genders.", it gives me something to think about almost every week. [[archives](https://us16.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=9a0a385211ebb7b21b0ef828a&id=908a07a835)]
- [Letters to Summer](http://letterstosummer.com/) by [Jillian G. Meehan](https://twitter.com/jilliangmeehan) and [summer farah](https://twitter.com/summabis) is a biweekly newsletter about just, well, interesting stuff. [[archives](http://letterstosummer.com/)]
- [Garbage Day](http://garbageday.substack.com/) by [Ryan Broderick](https://twitter.com/broderick), which gives you just the weirdest stuff from the internet every Friday. May be borderline NSFW at times. [[archives](http://garbageday.substack.com/)]
- [Podcast Idea](https://podcastidea.substack.com/) by [Rose Eveleth](https://twitter.com/roseveleth) gives you weekly fictional podcast ideas. [[archives](https://podcastidea.substack.com/)]

Last but not least, not strictly a newsletter but [Spoonbill](https://spoonbill.io/) is useful to know what the people you follow on twitter are up to.
