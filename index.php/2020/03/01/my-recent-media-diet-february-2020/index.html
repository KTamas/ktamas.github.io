<p>Time to catch up with things I&rsquo;ve been watching/enjoying! I am shamelessly copying <a href="https://kottke.org/19/06/my-recent-media-diet-summer-solstice-2019-edition">Kottke&rsquo;s format</a>, with some minor changes.</p>
<h1 id="books">Books</h1>
<p>I started reading <a href="https://fictionandfeeling.com/products/better-than-irl">Better Than IRL</a>, which is about the Old Internet and how people find community there. I hope I can finish it, I&rsquo;ve already read two essays from it.</p>
<h1 id="movies">Movies</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3224458/">A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019)</a>: I did not grow up with Mr. Rodgers, in fact I have not heard of him at all before <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7681902/">the documentary</a> came out last year. I was very cynical going it but by the end, it won me over to at least some degree. (B+)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9351980/">American Factory (2019)</a>: What happens when a Chinese company opens a factory in Ohio and cultures clash? This movie, among other things. It&rsquo;s an interesting watch, well worth it. (A)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1631867/">Edge of Tomorrow (2014)</a>: Rewatch. It&rsquo;s pretty good but it takes like half an hour for it to really get going and that kinda sucks. Still, once it gets going, it&rsquo;s great. (B+)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2121382/">Force Majure (2014)</a>: This was great, though I&rsquo;m not really happy with the ending. It didn&rsquo;t stress me out nearly as Marriage Story did, strangely. (A-)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926084/">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows (2010, 2011)</a>: Rewatch. I just wanted some emotional catharsis in my life and also our heroes being desperate in a forest. It kind of delivers on both, though not enough. The romantic pairings are a complete nonsense and the epilogue never happened. (B-)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/">Interstellar (2014)</a>: Wow, I was on a 2014 streak I guess? Anyways, another rewatch, the third time I&rsquo;ve seen this movie and I just, love it so much. Yes, the third act is not as great as the first two but I don&rsquo;t care. It&rsquo;s the epic space drama we very much needed, the sound is amazing, the visuals are amazing, the actors are amazing. (A)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11388580/">Miss Americana (2020)</a>: This is a pretty great documentary about Taylor Swift and I enjoyed it a lot. (A-)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111257/">Speed (1994)</a>: Technically a rewatch, although I&rsquo;ve only seen it as a kid and didn&rsquo;t remember too much. I thought it&rsquo;d be bad but actually this is a pretty good 90s action movie. (A-)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3172532/">The Diary of a Teenage Girl (2015)</a>: I&rsquo;ve been sort of meaning to watch this for years but I was kind of meh about it until I saw <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2525790/">Bel Powley</a> in The Morning Show where she&rsquo;s great and that gave me the final push. I didn&rsquo;t regret it; it&rsquo;s a decent coming-of-age movie. (B+)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9354842/">To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You (2020)</a>: I liked the first movie but I bailed halfway through on this one. Meh.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5727208/">Uncut Gems (2019)</a>: I tried watching it once and turned it off after 40 minutes because it was too stressful. I tried again about a month later and then I just dissociated enough to not feel anything. It&rsquo;s just not my movie, even though Adam Sandler is objectively great in it.</p>
<h1 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Carbon_(TV_series)">Altered Carbon (season 2)</a>: I really enjoyed this, I might even write a separate spoiler-filled review. I decided against rewatching the first season and in retrospect I kind of regret that. In any case, it was great, developing existing and new characters and the show&rsquo;s mythology. (A)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheer_(TV_series)">Cheer (season 1)</a>: I have mixed feelings about this show. I loved it, and now I&rsquo;m emotionally invested in several kids featured, but also I&rsquo;m wary of the whole authoritarian coach as a savior thing and worried what will happen to everyone once they stop doing cheerleading because it&rsquo;s a thing you can&rsquo;t do forever. In any case, I highly recommend it. (A+)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who">Doctor Who (season 12, episodes 6-9)</a>: This season has been a letdown overall but the last two episodes were not half bad, by Doctor Who standards anyway. Still, I&rsquo;m starting to miss Moffat, as bad as that era could be at times. (B-)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Fidelity_(TV_series)">High Fidelity (season 1)</a>: I&rsquo;ll be honest, I haven&rsquo;t seen the movie in ages, but I enjoyed the twists the made with this show. Zoë Kravitz is great and so are the supporting characters. I hope it gets another season. (A-)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Maintenance">High Maintenance (season 4, episodes 1-3)</a>: The best show about New York is back with an amazing first episode and two other ones that are, at parts, a bit meh, but even a &ldquo;meh&rdquo; High Maintenance episode is a great High Maintenance episode; they have such a high bar. (A)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_(TV_series)">Homeland (season 8, episodes 1-3)</a>: One more season of Carrie ugly-crying, which so far has not really happened but all in due time. It&rsquo;s mostly the usual though episode 3 was quite good. (B)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Not_Okay_with_This">I Am Not Okay With This (season 1)</a>: So this is based on a comic book by the same person who wrote The End of the Fucking World (which I love) but the show is kind of a letdown. It&rsquo;s short and feels like the second half of the season is missing; it has a lot of style, but not enough substance. If they make another season, I&rsquo;ll watch it but I&rsquo;m still somewhat disappointed. (B-)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMillions">McMillions (miniseries)</a>: I wanted to like this, but I quit after 3 episodes. As much as I like Agent Doug, they drag out the story too much and that kind of ruins it for me.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythic_Quest:_Raven%27s_Banquet">Mythic Quest: Raven&rsquo;s Banquet (season 1)</a>: A sitcom about a game studio. This takes 2-3 episodes to warm up but if you stick with it, it gets really good. Episode 5 is particularly great. (A-)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupied">Occupied (season 1)</a>: I bailed on this around episode 8. I wanted to like this but I mostly watched it because it&rsquo;s a Norwegian show. It&rsquo;s just&hellip; not good.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Picard">Star Trek: Picard (season 1, episodes 3-6)</a>: I continue to be very disappointed about this show, though episode 6 was not half bad so maybe it gets better in the second half? Let&rsquo;s hope so. (B-)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_of_Opportunity_(Stargate_SG-1)">Stargate SG-1 (season 4, episode 6 &ldquo;Window of Opportunity&rdquo;)</a>: This is something I rewatch every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)">Groundhog Day</a> because, well, it&rsquo;s the Groundhog Day episode of this show that I love very much and it&rsquo;s fun every single time. (A+)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magicians_(American_TV_series)">The Magicians (season 5, episodes 4-8)</a>: I love this show and the characters so fucking much. There was a fairly week episode this month but otherwise, it really delivers every week with all its unashamed craziness. (A)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_(TV_series)">UnREAL (season 2 episodes 9-10)</a>: This show is just, bad for me, not unlike You was not long ago. I will work very hard not to watch the final two seasons because again, bad for me. (B)</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m still watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Week_Tonight_with_John_Oliver">Last Week Tonight</a> and it&rsquo;s fine but the long segments are just increasingly meh.</p>
