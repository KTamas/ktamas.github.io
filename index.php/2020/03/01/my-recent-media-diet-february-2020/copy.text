My Recent Media Diet (February, 2020)
=====================================

Previously: [January](https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2020/02/01/my-recent-media-diet-january-2020/), [Best of Media, 2019](https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2020/01/02/best-of-media-2019/)

Time to catch up with things I've been watching/enjoying! I am shamelessly copying [Kottke's format](https://kottke.org/19/06/my-recent-media-diet-summer-solstice-2019-edition), with some minor changes.

# Books

I started reading [Better Than IRL](https://fictionandfeeling.com/products/better-than-irl), which is about the Old Internet and how people find community there. I hope I can finish it, I've already read two essays from it.


# Movies

[A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3224458/): I did not grow up with Mr. Rodgers, in fact I have not heard of him at all before [the documentary](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7681902/) came out last year. I was very cynical going it but by the end, it won me over to at least some degree. (B+)

[American Factory (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9351980/): What happens when a Chinese company opens a factory in Ohio and cultures clash? This movie, among other things. It's an interesting watch, well worth it. (A)

[Edge of Tomorrow (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1631867/): Rewatch. It's pretty good but it takes like half an hour for it to really get going and that kinda sucks. Still, once it gets going, it's great. (B+)

[Force Majure (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2121382/): This was great, though I'm not really happy with the ending. It didn't stress me out nearly as Marriage Story did, strangely. (A-)

[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows (2010, 2011)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926084/): Rewatch. I just wanted some emotional catharsis in my life and also our heroes being desperate in a forest. It kind of delivers on both, though not enough. The romantic pairings are a complete nonsense and the epilogue never happened. (B-)

[Interstellar (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/): Wow, I was on a 2014 streak I guess? Anyways, another rewatch, the third time I've seen this movie and I just, love it so much. Yes, the third act is not as great as the first two but I don't care. It's the epic space drama we very much needed, the sound is amazing, the visuals are amazing, the actors are amazing. (A)

[Miss Americana (2020)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11388580/): This is a pretty great documentary about Taylor Swift and I enjoyed it a lot. (A-)

[Speed (1994)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111257/): Technically a rewatch, although I've only seen it as a kid and didn't remember too much. I thought it'd be bad but actually this is a pretty good 90s action movie. (A-)

[The Diary of a Teenage Girl (2015)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3172532/): I've been sort of meaning to watch this for years but I was kind of meh about it until I saw [Bel Powley](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2525790/) in The Morning Show where she's great and that gave me the final push. I didn't regret it; it's a decent coming-of-age movie. (B+)

[To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You (2020)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9354842/): I liked the first movie but I bailed halfway through on this one. Meh.

[Uncut Gems (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5727208/): I tried watching it once and turned it off after 40 minutes because it was too stressful. I tried again about a month later and then I just dissociated enough to not feel anything. It's just not my movie, even though Adam Sandler is objectively great in it.

# TV Shows

[Altered Carbon (season 2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Carbon_(TV_series)): I really enjoyed this, I might even write a separate spoiler-filled review. I decided against rewatching the first season and in retrospect I kind of regret that. In any case, it was great, developing existing and new characters and the show's mythology. (A)

[Cheer (season 1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheer_(TV_series)): I have mixed feelings about this show. I loved it, and now I'm emotionally invested in several kids featured, but also I'm wary of the whole authoritarian coach as a savior thing and worried what will happen to everyone once they stop doing cheerleading because it's a thing you can't do forever. In any case, I highly recommend it. (A+)

[Doctor Who (season 12, episodes 6-9)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who): This season has been a letdown overall but the last two episodes were not half bad, by Doctor Who standards anyway. Still, I'm starting to miss Moffat, as bad as that era could be at times. (B-)

[High Fidelity (season 1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Fidelity_(TV_series)): I'll be honest, I haven't seen the movie in ages, but I enjoyed the twists the made with this show. ZoÃ« Kravitz is great and so are the supporting characters. I hope it gets another season. (A-)

[High Maintenance (season 4, episodes 1-3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Maintenance): The best show about New York is back with an amazing first episode and two other ones that are, at parts, a bit meh, but even a "meh" High Maintenance episode is a great High Maintenance episode; they have such a high bar. (A)

[Homeland (season 8, episodes 1-3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_(TV_series)): One more season of Carrie ugly-crying, which so far has not really happened but all in due time. It's mostly the usual though episode 3 was quite good. (B)

[I Am Not Okay With This (season 1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Not_Okay_with_This): So this is based on a comic book by the same person who wrote The End of the Fucking World (which I love) but the show is kind of a letdown. It's short and feels like the second half of the season is missing; it has a lot of style, but not enough substance. If they make another season, I'll watch it but I'm still somewhat disappointed. (B-)

[McMillions (miniseries)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMillions): I wanted to like this, but I quit after 3 episodes. As much as I like Agent Doug, they drag out the story too much and that kind of ruins it for me.

[Mythic Quest: Raven's Banquet (season 1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythic_Quest:_Raven%27s_Banquet): A sitcom about a game studio. This takes 2-3 episodes to warm up but if you stick with it, it gets really good. Episode 5 is particularly great. (A-)

[Occupied (season 1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupied): I bailed on this around episode 8. I wanted to like this but I mostly watched it because it's a Norwegian show. It's just... not good.

[Star Trek: Picard (season 1, episodes 3-6)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Picard): I continue to be very disappointed about this show, though episode 6 was not half bad so maybe it gets better in the second half? Let's hope so. (B-)

[Stargate SG-1 (season 4, episode 6 "Window of Opportunity")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_of_Opportunity_(Stargate_SG-1)): This is something I rewatch every [Groundhog Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)) because, well, it's the Groundhog Day episode of this show that I love very much and it's fun every single time. (A+)

[The Magicians (season 5, episodes 4-8)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magicians_(American_TV_series)): I love this show and the characters so fucking much. There was a fairly week episode this month but otherwise, it really delivers every week with all its unashamed craziness. (A)

[UnREAL (season 2 episodes 9-10)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_(TV_series)): This show is just, bad for me, not unlike You was not long ago. I will work very hard not to watch the final two seasons because again, bad for me. (B)

---

I'm still watching [Last Week Tonight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Week_Tonight_with_John_Oliver) and it's fine but the long segments are just increasingly meh.
