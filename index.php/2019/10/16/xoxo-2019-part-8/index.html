<p>I woke up way too early, around 7:30 and checked the Slack as the previous night there were talks of having breakfast together with the people who were still in town. After returning the coats I got from Pendelton, I made my way to La Luna Cafe where we basically took over the whole place. I had some really great conversations with <a href="https://twitter.com/spongefile">Tina</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/li3n3">Liene</a> about America, exceptionalism and different perspectives. I got a great compliment from <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanw">Dylan</a>, as he turned to someone: “You don’t know Tamas? Tamas is like a hub [for people].” Liene also gave me a compliment: &ldquo;You’re an includer and I appreciate that.” All of this means a lot to me.</p>
<p>Afterward I got an invite to a lunch with a bunch of other people, which meant a lot to me (you know who you are.) I had a great time there as well, though anxiety started setting in again and the fact that XOXO is, in fact, over. I said goodbye to a few more people then went back to our Airbnb with Emory to check out. He was headed home, while my flight was the next day. I was staying at a kind XOXOer&rsquo;s place who offered to host me for a night back when my travel plans changed.</p>
<p>I dropped off my things, <a href="https://twitter.com/joshmillard">Josh</a> brought me a T-shirt that I ordered and arrived; we also said our goodbyes.</p>
<p>I took a bus to downtown, then scooted around to get a bunch of shopping done as well as return something to Amazon. I got a year&rsquo;s worth of Omega 3 capsules that cost me peanuts compared to what I pay in Hungary; a couple of tiny bottles of Tylenol and Advil because I love those tiny bottles (and they are useful). At one point I ran into <a href="https://twitter.com/dunjalazic">Dunja</a> downtown and made plans to get dinner later.</p>
<p>I went by Powell&rsquo;s to look for the kind of stickers Skyler gave me but unfortunately didn&rsquo;t find any; then I scooted to REI to get a bunch of water bottles and socks I needed.</p>
<p>I met up with Dunja, <a href="https://twitter.com/fonorobert">Robert</a> and Djordje at Sizzle Pie for dinner — they had decent slices but nothing special. We played with the Panic sign then said goodbye; I&rsquo;ll see Robert back home next week and Dunja is just a short flight away in Berlin.</p>
<p>I went back to the place I was staying at and then, XOXO was really over. I had a flight the next morning home, a trip almost 2 days long for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>To wrap things up, I have one more post, with a few closing thoughts and a bunch of #gratitude.</p>
