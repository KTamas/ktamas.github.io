<p>I woke up around 8:30 to a horrible nightmare, in which I was banned from XOXO because I tried to sneak someone I know in who&rsquo;s an asshole. On the way to Rev Hall, I took a duckface selfie for <a href="https://twitter.com/janklausa">Jan</a>, who couldn&rsquo;t come this year.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rEiWXdf.jpg" alt="selfie"></p>
<p>I got to the venue around 9:30 and got breakfast once again at Fried Egg I&rsquo;m in Love. It felt like the first day of fall: instead of shorts and sandals, I wore jeans and my new shoe, that needed some breaking in.</p>
<p>I took quite a few portraits that morning, including this one of <a href="https://twitter.com/maxisnow">Max</a>, that&rsquo;s one of my
favorites:</p>

<p>I also ran into <a href="https://twitter.com/AviBagla">Avi</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DunjaLazic">Dunja</a>, Djordje and <a href="https://twitter.com/fonorobert">Robert</a> as well.</p>

<p>I was about to get Pip&rsquo;s for dessert when I ran into a group of people giving away free Blue Star donuts; they were quite good.</p>
<p>I went to Martha&rsquo;s to get my usual morning coffee (a decaf iced latte) and to watch the simulcast of the conference; turns out it was only streamed to the other bar. I went over there but as it turns out, watching a talk and trying to write just doesn&rsquo;t work, so back to Martha&rsquo;s to finish the day&rsquo;s post.</p>
<p>I do want to make note of the emcees&rsquo; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the Andy&rdquo; joke, which was really funny.</p>
<p>Once I was done, I went back to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS1k88LzjkQ">Harry Brewis&rsquo; talk</a>, which was not bad, though I somehow expected more than just the recap of his famous livestream last year. I also caught the tail end of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHp_DwVm2EA">Emma Kinema&rsquo;s talk</a> about game industry unions before that.</p>
<p>After the morning talks, we took a group photo of all the bald people we could gather, organized by Elly:</p>

<p>In the lunch break, I took more portraits. I also met F6x and got to thank him for the help he gives us.</p>

<p>Around 2 pm, we did an encore of Tim Tam Slam Jam, showing more people this now-tradition. Afterwards I got to chat a bit with <a href="https://twitter.com/RottenInDenmark">Michael Hobbs</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Remember_Sarah">Sarah Marshall</a>, hosts of one of my favorite podcast, <a href="https://twitter.com/yourewrongabout">You&rsquo;re wrong about&hellip;</a> Michael also tried slamming and liked it a lot. I also took their picture.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I watched most of the talks: a couple of them were okay, the one that really stood out for me was by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW32yUEymvU">Hundred Rabbits</a>; they talked about sailing around the world and all the challenges that come with that.</p>
<p>After the conference ended, I headed to Martha&rsquo;s for a break where I ran into <a href="https://twitter.com/doug_hanke">Doug Hanke</a>. We talked like an hour about various life stuff and it was just a really great and meaningful conversation.</p>
<p>Before Story, I had a good chat with Elina Levkovskaya about fashion, and got to tell <a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewBogart">Matthew Bogart</a> that I love <a href="https://www.incredibledoom.com/">Incredible Doom</a> (I should finish reading it, now that the entire first volume is up online.)</p>
<p>I got a front seat for Story that started with You&rsquo;re Wrong About. They talked about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVIII_halftime_show_controversy">Janet Jackson Superbowl Halftime Controversy</a> and it was really great to see them live. This was followed by <a href="https://www.everythingisalive.com/">Everything is Alive</a> that interviewed a chainsaw; it was surprisingly entertaining. I took a small break to find my favorite tote bag that I managed to lose twice one day, then went back and caught most of  <a href="https://www.earwolf.com/show/yo-is-this-racist/">Yo, is this racist?</a>, where <a href="https://twitter.com/electrolemon">Demi</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/miel">Miel</a> were guests. They had some really touching questions from the audience in the end.</p>
<p>Next, <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenZaltzman">Helen Zaltzman</a> talked about pronouns in a live production of <a href="https://twitter.com/AllusionistShow">The Allusionist</a>. The final show that night was arguably the best one: the last episode of <a href="https://twitter.com/punchupthejam">Punch up the Jam</a> with Demi in it; they had <a href="https://twitter.com/neilcic">Neil Cicierega</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Mike_Eagle">Open Mike Eagle</a> for guests. The whole thing is up on Youtube and you should watch it; it&rsquo;s laugh-out-loud hilarious. I don&rsquo;t remember the last time I laughed that much listening to — well, watching — a podcast. They talked about the Ghostbusters theme song which turned into an in-joke for the rest of the conference. I even made a tribute page for it that lives at <a href="https://ghostbuste.rs/">ghostbuste.rs</a>.</p>

<p>The day was not yet over; earlier that night I got invited to a house party by Juan, so that was my next stop. The party was great but loud and that&rsquo;s not my kind of thing so I ended up resting in a quieter room. <a href="https://twitter.com/jonahedwards">Jonah</a> ordered a bunch of pizza us; he also gave me another 90s temporary tattoo and I got two more for the future: one &ldquo;Under Construction&rdquo; and another that says &ldquo;Sign My Guestbook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at that party I got to talk with <a href="https://twitter.com/EssentialRandom">Vale</a> — who&rsquo;s now a regular here at WriteTogether — about life, freelancing, 3D printing a fuck machine and she also showed her 3D-printed glow-in-the-dark Luigis on the cross with the Evangelion spear in their chest. I managed to get one of them in the form of a fridge magnet the next day.</p>
<p>I got home around 2:15 am and went to sleep around 3. It was also the first day that I wore my new sneakers, and they were not really comfortable; ultimately it turned out they are just not a good fit at all.</p>
