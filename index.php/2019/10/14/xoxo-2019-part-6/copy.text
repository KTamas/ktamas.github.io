XOXO 2019: Part 6 - Saturday
============================

(Previously: [Prologue](https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/25/xoxo-2019-prologue/), [Part 1 - Monday](https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/26/xoxo-2019-part-1/), [Part 2 - Tuesday](https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/27/xoxo-2019-part-2/), [Part 3 - Wednesday](https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/28/xoxo-2019-part-3/), [Part 4 - Thursday](https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/29/xoxo-2019-part-4/), [Part 5 - Friday](https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/09/30/xoxo-2019-part-5/))

I woke up around 8:30 to a horrible nightmare, in which I was banned from XOXO because I tried to sneak someone I know in who's an asshole. On the way to Rev Hall, I took a duckface selfie for [Jan](https://twitter.com/janklausa), who couldn't come this year.

I got to the venue around 9:30 and got breakfast once again at Fried Egg I'm in Love. It felt like the first day of fall: instead of shorts and sandals, I wore jeans and my new shoe, that needed some breaking in.

I took quite a few portraits that morning, including this one of [Max](https://twitter.com/maxisnow), that's one of my 
favorites:

I also ran into [Avi](https://twitter.com/AviBagla), [Dunja](https://twitter.com/DunjaLazic), Djordje and [Robert](https://twitter.com/fonorobert) as well.

I was about to get Pip's for dessert when I ran into a group of people giving away free Blue Star donuts; they were quite good.

I went to Martha's to get my usual morning coffee (a decaf iced latte) and to watch the simulcast of the conference; turns out it was only streamed to the other bar. I went over there but as it turns out, watching a talk and trying to write just doesn't work, so back to Martha's to finish the day's post.

I do want to make note of the emcees' "Who's the Andy" joke, which was really funny.

Once I was done, I went back to watch [Harry Brewis' talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS1k88LzjkQ), which was not bad, though I somehow expected more than just the recap of his famous livestream last year. I also caught the tail end of [Emma Kinema's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHp_DwVm2EA) about game industry unions before that.

After the morning talks, we took a group photo of all the bald people we could gather, organized by Elly:

In the lunch break, I took more portraits. I also met F6x and got to thank him for the help he gives us.

Around 2 pm, we did an encore of Tim Tam Slam Jam, showing more people this now-tradition. Afterwards I got to chat a bit with [Michael Hobbs](https://twitter.com/RottenInDenmark) and [Sarah Marshall](https://twitter.com/Remember_Sarah), hosts of one of my favorite podcast, [You're wrong about...](https://twitter.com/yourewrongabout) Michael also tried slamming and liked it a lot. I also took their picture.

In the afternoon, I watched most of the talks: a couple of them were okay, the one that really stood out for me was by [Hundred Rabbits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW32yUEymvU); they talked about sailing around the world and all the challenges that come with that. 

After the conference ended, I headed to Martha's for a break where I ran into [Doug Hanke](https://twitter.com/doug_hanke). We talked like an hour about various life stuff and it was just a really great and meaningful conversation. 

Before Story, I had a good chat with Elina Levkovskaya about fashion, and got to tell [Matthew Bogart](https://twitter.com/MatthewBogart) that I love [Incredible Doom](https://www.incredibledoom.com/) (I should finish reading it, now that the entire first volume is up online.)

I got a front seat for Story that started with You're Wrong About. They talked about the [Janet Jackson Superbowl Halftime Controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVIII_halftime_show_controversy) and it was really great to see them live. This was followed by [Everything is Alive](https://www.everythingisalive.com/) that interviewed a chainsaw; it was surprisingly entertaining. I took a small break to find my favorite tote bag that I managed to lose twice one day, then went back and caught most of  [Yo, is this racist?](https://www.earwolf.com/show/yo-is-this-racist/), where [Demi](https://twitter.com/electrolemon) and [Miel](https://twitter.com/miel) were guests. They had some really touching questions from the audience in the end.

Next, [Helen Zaltzman](https://twitter.com/HelenZaltzman) talked about pronouns in a live production of [The Allusionist](https://twitter.com/AllusionistShow). The final show that night was arguably the best one: the last episode of [Punch up the Jam](https://twitter.com/punchupthejam) with Demi in it; they had [Neil Cicierega](https://twitter.com/neilcic) and [Open Mike Eagle](https://twitter.com/Mike_Eagle) for guests. The whole thing is up on Youtube and you should watch it; it's laugh-out-loud hilarious. I don't remember the last time I laughed that much listening to — well, watching — a podcast. They talked about the Ghostbusters theme song which turned into an in-joke for the rest of the conference. I even made a tribute page for it that lives at [ghostbuste.rs](https://ghostbuste.rs/).

The day was not yet over; earlier that night I got invited to a house party by Juan, so that was my next stop. The party was great but loud and that's not my kind of thing so I ended up resting in a quieter room. [Jonah](https://twitter.com/jonahedwards) ordered a bunch of pizza us; he also gave me another 90s temporary tattoo and I got two more for the future: one "Under Construction" and another that says "Sign My Guestbook."

It was at that party I got to talk with [Vale](https://twitter.com/EssentialRandom) — who's now a regular here at WriteTogether — about life, freelancing, 3D printing a fuck machine and she also showed her 3D-printed glow-in-the-dark Luigis on the cross with the Evangelion spear in their chest. I managed to get one of them in the form of a fridge magnet the next day. 

I got home around 2:15 am and went to sleep around 3. It was also the first day that I wore my new sneakers, and they were not really comfortable; ultimately it turned out they are just not a good fit at all.
