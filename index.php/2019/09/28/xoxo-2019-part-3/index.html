I’ve had an idea for a T-shirt for years, and the week before XOXO I finally acted on it. I wanted to have a T-shirt with “Helvetica” in big, bold letters. Here, this is how it looks like:
It’s cool, right? At first, it’s nothing special. It’s just “Helvetica” in Helvetica. Right?
There, I zoomed in a bit. Can you see it yet?" />

<p>I&rsquo;ve had an idea for a T-shirt for years, and the week before XOXO I finally acted on it. I wanted to have a T-shirt with &ldquo;Helvetica&rdquo; in big, bold letters. Here, this is how it looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/K2QibN6.jpg" alt="Helvetica1"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool, right? At first, it&rsquo;s nothing special. It&rsquo;s just &ldquo;Helvetica&rdquo; in Helvetica. Right?</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/btVrpYH.jpg" alt="Helvetica2"></p>
<p>There, I zoomed in a bit. Can you see it yet?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just confused right now, seriously, good for you. If you&rsquo;re a person who knows a thing or two about typography, however, your eyes might start twitching. That&rsquo;s because the font here is Arial, and this T-shirt is designed to piss off a certain kind of font nerd.</p>
<p>Anyways, it arrived the day before, so I decided it&rsquo;s a good day to wear it.</p>
<hr>
<p>The day started with breakfast at Zell&rsquo;s Cafe with Emory. The place was highly rated, but the food was somewhat disappointing: way too much cheese on my eggs, disappointing fries, bread that tasted weird. For dessert, we took scooters to Voodoo Donuts, which I still prefer over Blue Star, don&rsquo;t @ me (we can all agree that Pip&rsquo;s is excellent, though, right?)</p>
<p>We wanted to check out the Panic sign since Emory has never seen it before.  I managed to lead us six blocks the wrong way, so Emory took over GPS duties for the rest of the trip. I kept getting/feeling slightly lost in Portland throughout my whole stay and couldn&rsquo;t quite get a handle of the city — even though I&rsquo;ve been there twice before. My stress and anxiety might have had something to do with that.</p>
<p>We did get to the Panic sign eventually, but as it turns out, it&rsquo;s not much fun during daytime; you can barely see the colors.</p>
<p>Our next stop was the nearby Pendelton store, where I got not one but two coats for a redacted amount of money. They were beautiful coats, but I ended up returning both of them after the festival, as neither of them was quite the right cut for my weird body shape. If I&rsquo;m spending that much money on a cloth item, they better be a good fit.</p>
<p>I took a break at Powell&rsquo;s cafe, carefully not taking a look at the books because I have a giant backlog of them already. I did finally pick up <a href="https://twitter.com/heartshapedsky">Amy Baio&rsquo;s</a> <a href="https://youthinkyouknowme.cards/">You Think You Know Me</a>, though. It is, in a way, an investment in my future as I don&rsquo;t have too many people I can play it with right now.</p>
<p>It was around that time I connected with Dunja, Robert and Djordje, who arrived the day before; we met up in front of Revolution Hall just before 2 pm. I met Dunja at XOXO 2016; she was one of the few people from Eastern Europe. She introduced me to Robert in 2018, who&rsquo;s also from Hungary; we hung out a bunch the past year. I haven&rsquo;t met Djordje before; it was his first XOXO. He was Dunja&rsquo;s friend from Serbia.</p>
<p>I saw on Twitter that Andrew just got in town and was looking for something to do so I invited him along.</p>
<p>We walked around the city, north on SE 13th St. then turned right on E Burnside St, wandering around and exploring the city for at least an hour. We ended up in Laurelhurst Park, which was pretty beautiful. After a short break, we each went our separate ways: Andrew to a museum, Dunja &amp; co to get SIM cards and I walked to Belmont to get a late lunch.</p>
<p>I found a place called Straight From New York Pizza, and they had decent slices, though the New York part felt like a bit of a stretch.</p>
<p>Anticipating a high anxiety day as something triggered that the day before, I booked a massage at the Common Ground Wellness Co-op that someone recommended on the Slack. They were my next stop; I took a Lyft there. After checking in, I got undressed — the place is clothing optional — and had a great massage I really needed. Afterwards, I relaxed in their hot tub. It was a great place, and I would probably be a regular if I&rsquo;d be living in Portland.</p>
<p>Once done, I took another Lyft back to APEX, for the now-traditional pre-XOXO Wednesday night beers. I got to have a great conversation with Andy McMillan, Jonah, Crystal, Dan and a few other people whose name escape me right now. Andy told us about his zero-proof cocktail bar, and we also learned quite a bit about Northern Ireland. For dinner, I got a rice bowl from a Vietnamese place across the street; it was pretty okay. It was a fantastic evening; it was there where I started feeling the energy XOXO gives you, and that carried me through the rest of the week. That, and all the fantastic people.</p>

Andy and Henry. So cute. Henry, that is (Andy if you&rsquo;re reading this you look great as well.)</p>
<p>I got back to my Airbnb around 11, and it took me a while to fall asleep: I was pretty excited about the next few days. XOXO would be (officially) starting the next day.</p>
