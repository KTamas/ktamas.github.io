The excitement from the previous night lasted till the next morning as I woke up way too early, around 6 am. I had a Skype session with my therapist, then went to the La Luna Cafe for breakfast. The past week or so, I kept inviting XOXO friends, both old and new for a pre-registration breakfast. A lot of them came: Dan, Emory, Eliza, Georgie, her husband Nick, her friend Kylie, Andrew, Jim, Ben, Joel, Tiffany and I might be forgetting people." />

<p>The excitement from the previous night lasted till the next morning as I woke up way too early, around 6 am. I had a Skype session with my therapist, then went to the La Luna Cafe for breakfast. The past week or so, I kept inviting XOXO friends, both old and new for a pre-registration breakfast. A lot of them came: Dan, <a href="https://twitter.com/emorydunn">Emory</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gravitytrope">Eliza</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/georgiecel">Georgie</a>, her husband <a href="https://twitter.com/nicholascooke">Nick</a>, her friend <a href="https://twitter.com/kylietimpani">Kylie</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewTheWhip">Andrew</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jwithy">Jim</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gamedesignerben">Ben</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/notdetails">Joel</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tiffalopolus">Tiffany</a> and I might be forgetting people. The food was the delicious and the company was great; by the end, though, I was a bit peopled out, and earlier that day something triggered my anxiety again, and I was starting to feel that.</p>

The breakfast crew</p>
<p>The previous night I somehow managed to knock down my entire nightstand and my glasses got slightly bent, so I went to Myopic Optometry to fix them (you guessed it, someone recommended them on Slack.) Jim gave me a ride back to Revolution Hall for registration; we arrived almost at noon sharp. After picking up my badge and the swag, I started taking and printing portraits. I also met old and new friends as people started trickling in.</p>

<p>I was planning on staying there for a couple of hours, but the sun was literally burning my skin, so after a lunch at Meat Cheese Bread where I got way too many grilled cheese sandwiches, I went to Push X Pull a couple blocks away to take a break. I hung out with <a href="https://twitter.com/lyyyndseyyy">Lyndsey</a> a bit there, then got some writing done. Georgie and Nick arrived shortly after, but we mostly just enjoyed each other's company in silence, if that's a thing (it's a thing.)</p>

<p>I went to the Metafilter meetup afterwards, though I didn't stay too long. I did take this portrait of Josh and Phil, though:</p>

<p>The lack of sleep and the high anxiety was really getting to me, so I went back to my Airbnb. I took a long bath and a nap; they helped a bit.</p>
<p>I arrived back at Revolution Hall around 6. While waiting I ran into <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@annika">Annika</a> and her friends, got a Fronds pin and I admired her Raspberry Pi Zero/e-ink display project that she was wearing: it was showing stats from the XOXO Mastodon server that she's running. I took a few more portraits, including a really good one of <a href="https://twitter.com/notdetails">Joel</a>.</p>

<p>More people trickled in. I ran into <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanw">Dylan</a> and had a random chat with someone who was also waiting for the park to open.</p>
<p>Once the clock hit 7 pm and the park opened for the opening party, I went straight for the food carts. I got dinner from the Filippino place and it was extremely good food. Rice, noodles, skewers of chicken and two pork egg rolls, all of them excellent. I topped them with a copious amount of sweet and sour/soy sauce.</p>
<p>For dessert I went to the Churros truck which did not disappoint either; it pains me that we only had them for the first two days.</p>
<p>I got to hang out with a lot of people at the opening party. I met Skyler and her friends: got a cute turtle sticker from her for my badge. I got to know <a href="https://twitter.com/theearlcarlson">Earl</a> who was having a small concert the next day. I chatted with with <a href="https://twitter.com/li3n3">Liene</a>, who I knew from the Slack but we didn't talk much in real life before. I met <a href="https://twitter.com/maxisnow">Max</a>, with whom we helped to save/migrate one of Andy McMillan's old sites a few weeks before; later I would take one of my favorite portraits of him. And I finally got to hang out with <a href="https://twitter.com/_loveallthis">Sarah</a>; we kind of knew each other from Twitter but never met before.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zijYL2Q.jpg" alt="badge">
The turtle <em>is</em> really cute.</p>
<p>By 9 pm I was getting tired — the glass of wine I had didn't help — so I sat down at a table, where I met with Dunja again. She wasn't feeling that great either and it was great to commiserate with someone together over shared anxieties and such.</p>
<p>In the big tent, people were playing <a href="http://www.jsjoust.com/">Johann Sebastian Joust</a>; it looked fun, but there were a lot of people waiting for it, so I called it an evening just before 10 pm, went back to my Airbnb, took a shower, went to sleep.</p>
