My Recent Media Diet (February, 2019)
=====================================

Here's a bunch of television I've been enjoying recently.

**[Russian Doll](https://www.netflix.com/title/80211627):** This was the highlight of recent times: 8 episodes of pure fun, with a proper ending. It's best watched not knowing anything about it but here are the first five minutes: Nadia leaves her birthday party, and on the way home gets hit by a taxi, and dies. The next moment Nadia is back where the episode started, alive and well, on her own birthday party. It's up on Netflix.

**[Star Trek: Discovery (Season 2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Star_Trek_Discovery_title_card.jpg):** I've only seen three episodes of the new season so far but all of them have been great and I very much like this new take on Star Trek. The fact that it's a prequel to The Original Series bothers me, though, because they could have had a lot more creative freedom and do less retconning if it would be set in another universe. It's also up on Netflix or CBS All Access if you're in the US.

**[Hanna (pilot)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna_(TV_series))**: This is based on the excellent [movie of the same name](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993842/). Hanna is raised in the forest by his father in isolation, training her to be self-sufficient and strong, because someone in the CIA is hunting them for Reasons we don't know yet. The pilot shows a lot of promise, but we'll have to wait until March to see the rest. It's up on Amazon Prime Video.

**[Strike Back (Season 5)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_Back_(TV_series))**: A big, dumb action series about Section 20, a black ops group of MI6, saving the world, or at least parts of it. The writers' contract mandated at least two machine-gun fights per episode. It's... okay at best, I won't be watching Season 6.

**[Counterpart (Season 2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpart_(TV_series))**: Just before the end of the Cold War, scientists in East Germany discovered a parallel universe, a clone of theirs. In present day, Howard is working as a low-level bureucrat at the UN, overseeing the connection between those worlds, too low on the food chain to know what his actual work is about. Until one day, his "other" shows up, demanding to speak with him...  
Season 2 has one episode left but so far the series shows no signs of getting boring or tired. Highly recommended.

**[The Good Place (Season 3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Place)**: This has been quite a ride, huh? The first part of the season is a bit disorganized but it gets better as they go along and boy did they put on hell of a season finale. Can't wait for Season 4. If you haven't seen this series, check it out and don't read anything about it, because spoilers can ruin at least half the fun. Should be up on Netflix in Europe.

**[The Punisher (Season 2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Punisher_(TV_series))**: I loved the first season, but I quit this season after four episodes. The antagonist of Season 2 is just really, really bad. If you can get past that, it's on Netflix.

What have you been watching lately?
