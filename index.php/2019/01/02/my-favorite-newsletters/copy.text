My favorite newsletters
=======================

Newsletters are the new blogs, they say, and I hope not because I hate getting email. And yet there is ~content~ in newsletters, good content, so here's a few that I subscribe to and like.

- [Charged](http://char.gd) - I guess this one needs no introduction to this community ;)
- [The week that was](http://tinyletter.com/iankennedy) - [Ian Kennedy](https://twitter.com/iankennedy)'s once-a-week newsletter with usually ten links to interesting, unusual stories from all over the world. Anything from someone [winning a vacation to Winnipeg, Canada](https://www.thespec.com/whatson-story/9079216-price-is-right-contestant-wins-winter-trip-to-winnipeg/) to [punishing a San Francisco developer's illegal demolition by forcing the guy to rebuild the exact replica of the building](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/iankennedy/the-week-that-was-31/13264373-www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/city-requires-property-owner-who-demolished-13467909.php?c=aab663ab-1d04-4dad-83bc-9281105551c5). [[archives](https://tinyletter.com/iankennedy/archive)]
- [Jenny Shen's newsletter](http://jennyshen.com/newsletter/) - I met [Jenny](https://twitter.com/jennyshen) (and [recorded a podcast with her](https://soundcloud.com/ktamasenty/untitled-podcast-episode-1-xoxo-recap)!) at XOXO 2018. She writes about design, her life, being a PoC in technology and everything in-between.
- [Laura Olin](https://tumblr.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=8014320de9941eaab79e8a1ce&id=a6274aff24) - Another XOXO alum, sending out interesting things from all over the internet once a week. She has an interesting perspective on things. She also has a list of job opportunities in the media at the end of every newsletter.

- [Nicole Knows](https://nicole.substack.com/) - This is [The Toast](http://the-toast.net/) alum [Nicole Cliffe](http://twitter.com/nicole_cliffe)'s newsletter, do yourself a favor and follow her on twitter immediately as well. It's a mix of fun and weird Reddit threads and skincare. [[archives](https://nicole.substack.com/)]
- [NextDraft](https://nextdraft.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ed102783e87fee61c1a534a9d&id=dd6d48f649) - A daily newsletter from [Dave Pell](https://twitter.com/davepell), managing editor of the Internet. A mix of US politics and interesting random things. [[archives](https://us2.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=ed102783e87fee61c1a534a9d&id=dd6d48f649)]
- [Things That Have Caught My Attention](https://tinyletter.com/danhon) - by [Dan Hon](http://twitter.com/hondanhon). An irregular newsletter with Dan's thoughts on a variety of issues, and the occasional weird fiction. It's long, but it's worth reading.  [[archives](https://tinyletter.com/danhon/archive)]
- [The Shatner Chatner](https://www.shatnerchatner.com/) - By [The Toast](http://the-toast.net/) (and XOXO) alum [Daniel Mallory Ortberg](https://twitter.com/danielortberg). A mix of fiction and just plain weird but fun stuff. [[archives](https://www.shatnerchatner.com/)]
- [The Web Is OK](https://aarongilmore.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=9ddd4dee57ef929930b1a90b4&id=8e47b7eb4a) - By [Aaron Gilmore](https://twitter.com/aarondgilmore), XOXO alum, coming in your inbox once a few with a few interesting stories from the web. [[archives](https://us5.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=9ddd4dee57ef929930b1a90b4&id=8e47b7eb4a)]
- [Leah Finnegan's newsletter](https://us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7d9a179d9349586da8d1fd80f&id=47c259ca85) - [Leah](https://twitter.com/leahfinnegan), from [The Outline](https://theoutline.com) writes mostly personal essays, and they are all pretty great. Check out her [latest one about Envy](https://mailchi.mp/theoutline/how-to-kill-your-envy?e=ec4ceb0247). [[archives](https://us14.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=7d9a179d9349586da8d1fd80f&id=47c259ca85)]
- [Jenn Schiffer's newsletter](https://jennmoney.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f74a824f6424f5f5819ec0f77&id=738ef47ea4) - Last but not least, [Jenn Schiffer](https://twitter.com/jennschiffer)'s newsletter never disappoints. Hard to put it in a box. It's wacky, and it's fun.
