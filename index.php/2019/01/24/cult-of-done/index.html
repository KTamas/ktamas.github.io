<p>I was planning to finish <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/02/02/re-take-your-pills-my-story-of-adhd/">my post about ADHD</a> today, but poor time management and unexpected troubles at work got in the way, so this is one of those posts that I&rsquo;ll just start writing, and the words will come because they usually do. That&rsquo;s all I have time for today.</p>
<p>I have to say I am unusually proud of myself about yesterday&rsquo;s post. I had something written already the day before yesterday, but I wasn&rsquo;t too happy with that; it was long and disorganized and lacked structure. I took a break, and the next day I started looking at it with fresh eyes. I started editing it, stumbled upon a good article in my research that provided me with an idea for structuring those 34 or so paragraphs. A journalist friend helpfully pointed out that adding subheadings helps to break the text up. I cleaned up a few things in the post with the help of <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> and <a href="http://hemingwayapp.com">Hemingway</a>.</p>
<p>Two hours or so later, I had something ready to publish. I could have written twice as much, given the time, but I would have had an even harder time structuring that, and it felt way too long already. I also didn&rsquo;t want to break my streak, which meant I had to publish it that day. So I decided I got to a point where I was reasonably and pressed &ldquo;Publish&rdquo; (and then quickly fixed five more things I discovered after that).</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;ve re-read the <a href="https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13">Cult of Done Manifesto</a> and to be honest, I don&rsquo;t agree with many of its points, but at least one of them I find very, very true:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps you from being done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel like the constraints WriteTogether gives you help you get writing done. You don&rsquo;t have any excuses: at least 300 words, each day, or you lose your streak. It&rsquo;s harsh, it could use some refinement (and likely will), but for now, I like it.</p>
<p>See you tomorrow, hopefully with Part 3 of my series done.</p>
