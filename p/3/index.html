<p><a href="https://blog.ktamas.com">I have a blog</a> (you&rsquo;re reading it!). It&rsquo;s got history: I set it up in early 2009, and I have almost 600 posts, mostly in Hungarian. I had one before that, between 2005 and 2008, but it was lost due to a variety of reasons, including my failure to properly back things up. Small bits of it are still <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070208165650/http://blog.ktamas.com/">up in the Wayback Machine</a>, though. It was all in Wordpress, which does its job, though even in 2019 it can be a pain to update things.</p>

<h3 id="from-wordpress-to-jekyll-to-hugo">From Wordpress to Jekyll to Hugo</h3>

<p>About a week ago I decided it was time to migrate it to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I was bored, and it gave me a good excuse to play with a static site generator. Plus, doing this kind of conversion became a rite of passage for people working in tech these days.</p>

<p><em>This is not a complete guide; you can find hundreds of them with a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+wordpress+to+jekyll">quick google</a>. I will, however, provide a general overview of the process with some helpful pointers and links.</em></p>

<p>I started by migrating all the comments to Disqus with their <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/disqus-comment-system/">official Wordpress plugin</a>. After that, I used a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jekyll-exporter/">Jekyll exporter plugin</a> that converted all my posts into markdown&hellip; except it stripped all the embeds.</p>

<p>I used to blog a lot about music, so I had a lot of embeds, mostly from Youtube. In retrospect, I could have saved myself some time by patching the exporter or finding another one. In the end, however, I ended up fixing every single post by hand. I replaced old, pre-iframe flash embed codes with updated ones and changed the newer, but still http ones to https. In most places, if the video was not necessary or wasn&rsquo;t available anymore, I added the song to the post via Spotify. The chances of a given song being up on Spotify in a few years feels <em>marginally</em> higher than on Youtube right now. I had a few other embeds that I could fix with newer code (Soundcloud) and others that I couldn&rsquo;t (Deezer), but most of the time I could find the given song or playlist within Spotify. All of this had the benefit of walking down on memory lane, reading 10-year old blog posts and cringing a lot. <em>I was so young.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;ve found a <a href="https://github.com/vinitkumar/white-paper">reasonably decent theme</a> for Jekyll, which felt like a good starting point, though it didn&rsquo;t have built-in support for tags or archives. I started googling how to implement that, and around the same time I was venting about my embed issues on the XOXO slack. That was when <a href="https://twitter.com/theory">David</a> chimed in about his experiences on doing this exact same process, except he ended up using <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, another popular static site generator that&rsquo;s kind of like Jekyll except faster. <a href="https://github.com/theory/justatheory/tree/master/themes/justatheory">The theme</a> of <a href="https://justatheory.com">his blog</a> had everything I wanted: a fancy archives page and proper support for tags. So I figured I might as well continue my journey: switch to Hugo and use his theme as a basis.</p>

<p>Jekyll is written in Ruby and uses a simple templating language. Hugo&rsquo;s code is in Go, and it uses Go&rsquo;s own templates; they definitely have a learning curve, even if you have coded in Go before. With some help, googling and a lot of trial and error, I got the hang of it and managed to change things to my liking as well as the look and the color scheme of the site. I converted most of my posts&rsquo; <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">front matter</a> <a href="https://github.com/coderzh/ConvertToHugo">with a script</a> and fixed the rest with a few search-and-replaces. With 8-10 hours of work behind me — half of that was fixing those embeds — I had my new blog ready to be <a href="https://pages.github.com/">hosted on Github Pages for free</a>. I use a modified version of the <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#put-it-into-a-script-1">sample deploy script</a> they have in Hugo&rsquo;s documentation.</p>

<h3 id="getting-rid-of-my-vps">Getting Rid of My VPS</h3>

<p>I had a small VPS at Linode for years now, hosting my pet projects, my blog and a bunch of static sites (like my <a href="https://ktamas.com">home page</a>) over the years. It also had OpenVPN installed so I could watch iPlayer for free until BBC started cracking down on that. By now it only had my blog and those static sites; I figured if I could find something for the latter, I could ditch the VPS entirely.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember how, but I came across <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a>. They give you free static hosting with extremely generous soft limits (100 gigs of storage, 100 GB/month transfer). You just point them to a Github repository, and about 30 seconds later you have your site ready, with support for multiple custom domains and SSL.</p>

<p>I spent an hour or two moving everything to Netlify, changing the necessary DNS entries and in the end, I was ready to say goodbye to my VPS and save a grand total of $7 a month in the future. I made backups of everything and then, somewhat emotionally pressed the &ldquo;Delete&rdquo; button on Linode&rsquo;s control panel. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if I would get another one eventually for a side project or something, but for now, I&rsquo;m happy with my all my stuff hosted around the internet for free and stored in git repos.</p>

<h3 id="on-the-future-of-my-blog">On the Future of My Blog</h3>

<p>There is a lot more content to come as I started writing regularly. Feel free to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/KTamasBlog">subscribe to this blog</a> in your favorite RSS reader.</p>

<p>Hugo gives me a lot of ways to tinker; I am already thinking about replacing the commenting system, adding reading time, word count and so on. I might write something on this in again in the future.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sitting in a wine bar and waiting for my friends to arrive to hang out. I spent my free time today working my converting my blog from Wordpress to Hugo — with a detour of Jekyll — and moving my static sites to Netlify so that I can shut down my barely-used VPS. A full write-up about this is coming soon.</p>

<p>I have about 20 minutes before said friends arrive so this will be one of those stream of consciousness posts where I just start writing and see what comes out of it.</p>

<hr />

<p>For the longest time, I did not like neither beer nor wine. Sure, both are acquired tastes, but I tried plenty (especially beer) and it just never clicked. To this day the only beer I drink is alcohol-free lager since it&rsquo;s the one that tastes the least like actual beer and it has the advantage of, well, not having alcohol in it. If I wanted to get tipsy or drunk I would go with shots or cocktails. That changed in recent years, though; I finally got a taste of wine, dry red wine, to be exact.</p>

<hr />

<p>I mentioned a bunch of times already that in 2012 my untreated anxiety disorder got to the point where I started having panic attacks and forced me to seek treatment. One of the side-effects of all this is that my stomach was shot. I had severe discomfort/pain for months; at one point, someone accidentally figured out that the primary cause was high stomach acid and antacid pills help. Slowly, I started recovering. To aid the process and my digestion (in retrospect, maybe my anxiety as well), my old GP, who was somewhat old-school prescribed me a deciliter of red wine, every day, after lunch. It&rsquo;s not like I had anything to lose, and it&rsquo;s not enough alcohol to get me tipsy anyway.</p>

<p>So I did that for like two months, and after a few weeks, I started not hating red wine. A few weeks after that, I was a convert. Since then it became my go-to drink of choice.</p>

<hr />

<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about wine. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good&rdquo; or &ldquo;It sucks&rdquo; is as far as I can go. I did develop preferences over the years; by far and large, I like a good Merlot or Pinot Noir. Above all, Shiraz (Syrah) wines, mostly from Australia and New Zealand are among my favorites.</p>

<p>When I lived in Sweden, I had the luxury of having a selection of 100s of different wines from at least 20 different countries. See, in Sweden, there is a government monopoly on selling alcohol above 3.5%; you can only buy the serious stuff in state-run alcohol shops. The pros and cons of this system are beyond the scope of this post, but one huge pro was the selection I&rsquo;ve mentioned above.</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;m back in Hungary now, and though there are stores where you can get import wine, most of the wine here is local. Which is not a bad thing, of course; Hungarian is a wine country, and our wine is renowned for its quality. I do miss being able to pick from all the different countries, though.</p>

<hr />

<p>My friends started arriving. Time for me to order a glass of Syrah&hellip;</p>

<p>Last night I went to bed feeling I might be getting sick, and I woke up most definitely sick. It feels like something in-between a cold and full-blown flu, and I mean, whatever, it&rsquo;ll pass. What bothers me is the timing: I started working with a personal trainer last week and been to 4 classes so far. Now I&rsquo;ll have to skip a bunch, and that&rsquo;s bad when you are building a habit.</p>

<p>I have at least one more post ready in my SF &amp; XOXO 2018 series (to come), but right now I&rsquo;m struggling to write end edit the ones that come after them. So I&rsquo;m taking a break today to reflect on writing, and in particular, writing here.</p>

<hr />

<p>This is my 31st post here, and I have not skipped a single day. I joined the day Owen opened signups. It&rsquo;s the second longest personal writing streak I have — the first one would be the one I did when I moved to Sweden and blogged about my life daily for the first few months. I&rsquo;m sure I skipped days here and there, but I wrote a lot during those days.</p>

<p>I used the term personal writing intentionally. Back in 2003, shortly after I started high school, I started working for a tech news site covering mobile devices, phones and PDAs.</p>

<p><em>(remember PDAs? I was</em> really <em>into them and had several over the years, even smartphones, and this was years before the iPhone. That&rsquo;s where most of the money I earned went.)</em></p>

<p>I kept track of what&rsquo;s up with the tech world and wrote a news article about whatever I&rsquo;ve found interesting and fit my scope. For the first two years or so I did it for free; after that, I earned roughly 75 cents per news article. I wrote a few features, reviews and interviews as well (can&rsquo;t remember how much I made from that, but not a lot).</p>

<p>In many ways, it was the dream writing job. I could write about anything I wanted, and the money I earned with it was significant for a 17-year old still living with their parents. I do feel somewhat ripped off financially in retrospect, though.</p>

<p>I stopped working for the site not long before I finished high school — I sort of lost interest. I think it had run its course.</p>

<p>Some habits do stay with me to this day from that era. Keeping up with the news is one of the reasons I got addicted to RSS and Google Reader. I read The Verge&rsquo;s and Ars Technica&rsquo;s feed religiously to this day, even though it is no longer necessary and I skip reading like 95% of it.</p>

<hr />

<p>All of the writing I mentioned above has been in Hungarian, though. This is the first time I am writing a significant amount in English, a language that&rsquo;s not my mother tongue. Now, I pride myself having a good grasp on the English language, and have been fluent in it since I was 15 or so. I don&rsquo;t even have the stereotypical Hungarian accent; it sounds like generic American English to most ears. When I lived in Sweden, I spoke English 90% of the time. I can and still do think in English a lot. When I&rsquo;m alone and am talking to myself, that&rsquo;s often in English as well.</p>

<p>And yet, writing is a different beast entirely. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m bad at it, but I&rsquo;m conscious of the fact that I&rsquo;m not great either, and have a lot to learn. I run everything I write through Grammarly and Hemingway, and they help, but they&rsquo;re not silver bullets. I started reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0090RVGW0/">On Writing Well</a> (<a href="https://writetogether.space/posts/owen/the-tyranny-of-writing">thanks, Owen</a>), since nonfiction writing is my thing. And posting here at least 300 words every day itself helps a lot.</p>

<hr />

<p>So here I am, 31 days later; a month done, who knows how many to go. And I enjoy it a lot, even though I have no metrics on how many people are reading these posts of mine (I like having an audience and will not apologize for that). For now, I&rsquo;ll go back to editing and rewriting my series. I have work to do.</p>

<p>I was planning to finish <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/02/02/re-take-your-pills-my-story-of-adhd/">my post about ADHD</a> today, but poor time management and unexpected troubles at work got in the way, so this is one of those posts that I&rsquo;ll just start writing, and the words will come because they usually do. That&rsquo;s all I have time for today.</p>

<p>I have to say I am unusually proud of myself about yesterday&rsquo;s post. I had something written already the day before yesterday, but I wasn&rsquo;t too happy with that; it was long and disorganized and lacked structure. I took a break, and the next day I started looking at it with fresh eyes. I started editing it, stumbled upon a good article in my research that provided me with an idea for structuring those 34 or so paragraphs. A journalist friend helpfully pointed out that adding subheadings helps to break the text up. I cleaned up a few things in the post with the help of <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> and <a href="http://hemingwayapp.com">Hemingway</a>.</p>

<p>Two hours or so later, I had something ready to publish. I could have written twice as much, given the time, but I would have had an even harder time structuring that, and it felt way too long already. I also didn&rsquo;t want to break my streak, which meant I had to publish it that day. So I decided I got to a point where I was reasonably and pressed &ldquo;Publish&rdquo; (and then quickly fixed five more things I discovered after that).</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;ve re-read the <a href="https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13">Cult of Done Manifesto</a> and to be honest, I don&rsquo;t agree with many of its points, but at least one of them I find very, very true:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps you from being done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel like the constraints WriteTogether gives you help you get writing done. You don&rsquo;t have any excuses: at least 300 words, each day, or you lose your streak. It&rsquo;s harsh, it could use some refinement (and likely will), but for now, I like it.</p>

<p>See you tomorrow, hopefully with Part 3 of my series done.</p>

<p>Yesterday I read Owen&rsquo;s <a href="https://writetogether.space/posts/owen/goals-1">&ldquo;Goals&rdquo; post</a> and at first, I thought I don&rsquo;t have any, but then I started writing them down and turns out I do! Without further ado, a list, well, many lists.</p>

<p>Short term / immediate / ongoing goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep writing 300 words a day (duh)</li>
<li>Find another steady freelance gig that&rsquo;s roughly 10-20 hours a week. I have a few leads, and I already have a long-term client with about 20 billed hours per week</li>
<li>Keep working with my personal trainer, thrice a week for an hour, which I literally just started (as in, today)</li>
<li>Somehow start losing weight. For that, I need to change what and how I eat and I don&rsquo;t yet know how I&rsquo;ll manage to do that</li>
<li>Keep drawing, at least once a week, ideally more</li>
<li>Fix my sleep schedule which is pretty fucked up right now</li>
<li>In general, keep up with my todo list (eternal goal, really)</li>
<li>Keep dating</li>
<li>Be more social/active in general</li>
<li>Cook more</li>
</ul>

<p>In 3 months, I want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lose at least 2 kilos</li>
<li>Have some idea on how I&rsquo;ll get my eating habits in order (we&rsquo;re setting realistic goals here, people)</li>
<li>Get my sleep schedule in order</li>
<li>Have that new freelance gig worked out</li>
<li>Have been on at least another date (again, realistic goals)</li>
<li>Have started working on the [oral history article I wrote about]()</li>
<li>Have held at least another dinner party</li>
<li>Be still writing 300 words a day, still drawing at least once a week, still working out thrice a week (this goal never ends)</li>
</ul>

<p>In 6 months, I want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lose at least 5kg</li>
<li>Have started getting my eating habits in order</li>
<li>Consider doing therapy again. I&rsquo;m on a break right now, but if I think I need more time, I&rsquo;ll give it another 6 months</li>
<li>Have been on at least 3 more dates</li>
<li>At least halfway done with that oral history article</li>
<li>Have held at least 2 more dinner parties</li>
<li>Still writing, still draw, still work out, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>In a year, I want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lose at least 10kg (stretch goal: anything above that, really)</li>
<li>Have my eating habits somewhat in order</li>
<li>Restart therapy with a plan of stopping certain anti-anxiety medications</li>
<li>Get my cholesterol back to normal levels (if not I&rsquo;ll likely have to start medication)</li>
<li>Have $REDACTED in savings</li>
<li>Published that oral history article</li>
<li>Re-evaluate my life concerning where I live, and see how much longer do I want to stay in Hungary and also the work I do</li>
<li>Be in a relationship (yes I know this is not how this works, but one can dream)</li>
<li>Be in some sort of leadership role in my church</li>
<li>Hold dinner parties at least once a month</li>
<li>Write, draw, work out, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 3 years, I want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lose 30kg (which is my target goal)</li>
<li>Have healthy eating habits</li>
<li>More money saved, obviously (as a freelancer it&rsquo;s hard to plan for even a year, three years feels impossible)</li>
<li>Have stopped taking said medications above</li>
<li>Be married (we&rsquo;re thinking big!)</li>
<li>Have my living situation figured out, possibly left Hungary or it&rsquo;s on the horizon</li>
<li>Do dinner parties/write/draw/work out, you know the drill</li>
</ul>

<p>In 5 years, I want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not live in Hungary</li>
<li>Have my weight still under 100kg</li>
<li>Still have healthy eating habits</li>
<li>Maybe buy a house?</li>
<li>Have a solid grasp on where my career is going, by this time I&rsquo;ll be 35 after all</li>
<li>Have a kid</li>
<li>Eh who knows about habits when you have a kid, but at least keep working out</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, I could go on, but I think this is a good start. Keep me accountable, please?</p>

        <div class="text">

<p>A bit more than a year ago, a couple weeks before Christmas an event popped up on my Facebook timeline. &ldquo;Free Hugs in Budapest&rdquo;, it said. Intrigued, I clicked on the &ldquo;Interested&rdquo; button, the universal bookmarking feature. I didn&rsquo;t think much of it afterward, but a few days later a photographer friend visiting from Sweden contacted me and asked if I&rsquo;m planning to attend. So we ended up going together, our cameras in hand, to take a few pictures; seemed like an interesting enough topic. I ended up bringing a wrong camera (hint: don&rsquo;t bring your old mirrorless camera that has shitty autofocus for fast-moving subjects) but did get a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ktamasphotovideo/posts/547084138989539">few</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ktamasphotovideo/posts/547084225656197">good shots</a>.</p>

<p>Besides being a good subject for photography, the idea appealed to me: a bunch of people at one of Budapest&rsquo;s busiest square, filled with tourists, giving out free hugs for an hour once a month on a Sunday afternoon. That&rsquo;s all there is to it, really.</p>

<hr />

<p>I was intrigued, so I went for the next two events as well—learning from my mistakes, I took my trusty DSLR—and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.564701503894469&amp;type=3">took</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/ktamasphotovideo/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=588050271559592">more pictures</a>. After three times, though, I was itching to put down the camera, take the leap and start giving out free hugs myself. So I did.</p>

<hr />

<p>Since then I&rsquo;ve been to almost all the events and became one of the very few regular volunteers. I enjoy it a lot: I like giving hugs, but it&rsquo;s not something you do too often in Hungary. And there is something pure and deeply satisfying in standing there for an hour, sign in your hand, waiting for strangers to walk up to you for a hug. It&rsquo;s an opportunity to have a momentary connection with a lot of people and to—excuse the cheese—spread some love in the world. We only have one rule, one we take seriously: we offer the hugs, never force them on people. For me it&rsquo;s like going to Church; I do that too, but this, this is also Church, a gathering of people for a common cause, to make the world just a little bit better.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Free Hugs Campaign <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Hugs_Campaign">was started in 2004 by an Australian guy</a>, though I&rsquo;d bet he wasn&rsquo;t the first one to do this since it&rsquo;s hardly a unique idea. The phenomenon has spread all over the world ever since, and by far and large is an entirely grassroots movement, unaffiliated with organizations or religions.</p>

<p>In Budapest, we don&rsquo;t even have a Facebook page or anything; it&rsquo;s organized by one person who creates the event every month, invites everyone he can, and then it spreads organically. Sometimes we have as many as 20 volunteers giving out hugs; other times, only 4; it&rsquo;s somewhat unpredictable. On occasion, people would walk by, and like the idea so much they&rsquo;d spontaneously join in.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve written in the intro, the event is held at a touristy area of Budapest; by my estimations, about 85-90% of people we hug are not Hungarians. That can partly be explained by the location, but I myself attribute it to this country&rsquo;s sometimes unwelcome, suspicious or cynical attitude towards these things. A surprising number of times people would walk by, and I heard them say some variation of &ldquo;oh, yeah, they&rsquo;re just gonna pickpocket you&rdquo; in Hungarian.</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this is for everyone. Some people simply don&rsquo;t like hugs, are uncomfortable with physical touch, or worse, have past traumas connected to it. And it requires you to really put yourself out there, and be at least somewhat vulnerable.</p>

<p>But if you have one in your city, and this sounds intriguing to you, I highly encourage you to try it. It&rsquo;s a good way to spend an hour on a Sunday afternoon.</p>

            <time datetime="2019-01-19T16:18:04Z">Saturday, January 19, 2019</time> · 557 words · 3 min read</div>
        </header>
        <div class="text">

<p>I have an ambitious idea: I want to write a longform article, an oral history of an early Twitter client/community called Turulcsirip (<a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=hu&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fhu.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTurulcsirip">wikipedia link with Google Translate</a>).</p>

<p>The story starts simple enough: in early 2007, a Hungarian guy called Benedek Toth has written a Twitter client called Turulcsirip. But it wasn&rsquo;t your average client as there were several things that made it special.</p>

<hr />

<p>While I registered an account on Twitter sometime in 2007, I haven&rsquo;t started tweeting until early 2008. I knew no-one, just followed a few internet-famous people and early adopters of the platform (remember <a href="https://twitter.com/hughcards?lang=en">Hugh MacLeod aka GapingVoid</a>?). I tweeted about things people tweeted about in those days: random things, saying good morning, work stuff.</p>

<p>Only a few days later I tweeted out something about ExtJS and someone Hungarian guy replied to it. I was baffled. How? They didn&rsquo;t even seem to be following me. And how did they find me anyway?</p>

<p>Turns out they were using Turulcsirip. I don&rsquo;t know all the details, but through the API it watched all tweets and with some fairly basic NLP it found people tweeting in Hungarian and automatically pulled them into the system and displayed their tweets on a public timeline.</p>

<p>See, Turulcsirip had three views. One, you could see whatever your followers are tweeting, the basic view. But two, you had a slider where you could start to see your followers&rsquo; followers&rsquo; tweets mixed into your timeline. And it had a third view where you would see everyone on the platform, which mean pretty much every Hungarian tweeting back then. It was a great way to discover new people, and in 2008, that timeline wasn&rsquo;t that busy, and if you found someone annoying or uninteresting, you could hide their tweets with a click or two. Turulcsirip even had a Firefox extension so you could have it in your sidebar, autoscrolling.</p>

<p>Through the app, I instantly became part of a community and in the next two years or so I made a lot of internet friends, many of whom became real-life friends. It was a great community, with barely any drama or politics (by today&rsquo;s standards, anyway). We also had a lot of twitter meetups, hanging out in pubs with semi-strangers you only knew from the internet before. You could see the bubbles: Tech People Twitter, People Selling Infoproducts Twitter, Teen Twitter and so on, bubbles that didn&rsquo;t really interact with each other. It was and still is fascinating.</p>

<hr />

<p>There are so many stories, from meetups, through competitors to its eventual demise in 2012. Friendships, relationships and marriages started there. There was the time when, in order to make Twitter more popular in Hungary, three people held a contest to get either 2009 or the most followers by a certain date, a number that sounds downright amusing these days (the winner only got to 1299). I could go on.</p>

<hr />

<p>And I want to go on: this is the extremely abridged version of the story. I have a mental list of about a dozen people to interview for this to happen, and I may even have the time for it. I&rsquo;m not a journalist—though I used to be, a long time ago—but this is something I definitely want to write because I believe it&rsquo;s such an important and unique part of the history of Early Twitter.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

<p>I have no idea what to write today but I will start, and I am sure words will come.</p>

<p>I have a couple of topics floating in my head for longer stories. One is obviously continuing my memoir about my time in Sweden but I&rsquo;ve hit a snag there: I got to the part where I arrived in Sweden, and now there are a couple of months where I am unsure what I should write about. It&rsquo;ll come, though.</p>

<p>I have another thing to write about: the story of Turulcsirip, an early Hungarian Twitter community that was quite unique at the time. Part of me wants to make a real article of it, an oral history: interview the guy who created it, the earliest users, and so on. But I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s a good fit for this platform. I can tell this story from just my perspective, and that would give you a somewhat good image of it as well, so I might just do that.</p>

<p>I am not yet sure if I want to write mostly multi-part stories (that you have to plan at least somewhat in advance) or more one-off things. For some reason, the former sounds easier for me, because if I just sit down to write <em>something</em>, I draw a blank. But that&rsquo;s something I want to improve as well.</p>

<p>Then again, I don&rsquo;t want to write just for writing&rsquo;s sake, only to have my streak, like I am doing right now. I want to write meaningful things, things people enjoy and find engaging. I feel like I have a lot of stories to tell; there is enough material. Now I just have to do the writing itself.</p>

<p>This whole post is just a shameless thing to get my streak, look, 300 words exactly.</p>

<p>I want to preface this that everything I write here may leave you scratching your head thinking &ldquo;this is not unusual at all&rdquo;. But it is for me.</p>

<p>I, like most people belong to different groups of friends, that function as bubbles. I have my online friends, my church friends, my friends from drawing class, my friends with whom I do free hugs every month and so on. And by far and large, these groups do not interact with each other at all, and that&rsquo;s partly on me. For whatever reason that I still need to work out with a therapist, I (sub)consciously keep these groups separate.</p>

<p>I think that is at least partly because I behave in slightly different ways, show different parts of myself to these different groups. Again, this mostly normal, and a ton of people do this, but I also know people who, by far and large don&rsquo;t do this, and furthermore they have no trouble whatsoever with their bubbles meeting &ndash; for them, they are not even bubbles.</p>

<p>Therefore a couple of years ago I decided to turn my birthday party into a social experiment: invite everyone from everywhere into one big party, and just see what happens. It was legitimately scary for me because, in that setting, I have to be myself, my real self, I can&rsquo;t do much pretending.</p>

<p>I am happy I did that because it was a huge success. I had about a dozen people from 3 or 4 different groups, and it was great to see them get to know each other.</p>

<p>This Saturday I&rsquo;m having a party again, with an even more diverse group. It&rsquo;s still scary, but now it&rsquo;s exciting as well. I&rsquo;m cooking some Mexican food, because as cliche as it is, food brings people together.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re all invited as long as you can make it to Hungary by 7 pm this Saturday. :)</p>

<p>Ten years ago I was working at a translation agency, being very enthusiastic about my job. I just started having a social life again after high school, finding real-life friends and community on Early Twitter, thanks to a Twitter client that auto-aggregated Hungarian users and connected them. (That&rsquo;s a story worth telling in itself, another time)</p>

<p>A lot has happened since then. I worked there for a few more years, then I moved to Sweden for four years and then moved back to Hungary. Somewhere in the middle of that, I went freelance, which overall turned out to be a huge success. I started taking care of my mental health, getting diagnosed and re-diagnosed, finding a psychiatrist, did almost six years of therapy. I traveled a lot; I&rsquo;ve been to most European countries by now as well as two trips to the US, both because of I got to be part of XOXO, but I&rsquo;ve visited other parts of the States as well. I did a small pivot in my career that so far worked out well. I lost two out of my four grandparents. <a href="https://blog.ktamas.com/index.php/2019/01/15/in-memoriam-of-sharewood-my-own-little-content-sharing-community/">Built and ran a small link-sharing community</a>. Grown a lot personally and professionally. Discovered running, did that for a few years. Found and lost friends and communities.</p>

<hr />

<p>Right now I&rsquo;m in a pretty great place. I have well-paying clients and hopefully picking up more freelance work soon. I&rsquo;m part of a great church, one that I was looking for all my life. I have good friends, some old, some new. I&rsquo;ve started drawing a few months ago, and I enjoy it immensely. Yesterday, after years of procrastination, I finally found myself a personal trainer and will begin working with her next week. Although my sister is moving out of our place, a good friend is taking her place in the room next to mine. I&rsquo;m having a birthday party on Saturday where I&rsquo;ll cook for my friends. I feel at home where I am.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here&rsquo;s to an even better 40.</p>
